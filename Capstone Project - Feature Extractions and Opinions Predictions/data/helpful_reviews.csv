B01DZJFWNC,The_Debrainer,5,"July 13, 2016",True,Moto G4 Plus 64GB - 4GB RAM,"{(((1 year update, well 11 months))) : this moto g4 plus is still going strong. no problems with it to report, still charges fast and holds a charge all day. } Ok so I've had this Moto G4 Plus (64GB storage with 4GB RAM) for 24 hours, and so this Isn't going to be a extensive review, just some things I've noticed... First of all, the build and feel of the phone is very good, not super premium like some $600 + phones, but its still very good. the fit is tight and uniform, no gaps around the screen or back cover or anything. the back cover snaps on and off without problems. the phone looks to be very well made. The android system takes up almost 10GB of storage, leaving the user with about 54.5 GB. CPU-Z shows there is 3643 MB of RAM The buttons for power and volume feel great, make a nice little clicky feel when you push them, and the power button is textured for an easy way to feel the difference between them. the finger print scanner, is very useful, (although it doesn't serve as a button for anything) it wakes the phone up and unlocks it super fast. I would estimate about 1/4 of a second or faster. So far finger print scanner is great, way better than i expected. The screen looks great, full HD 1080P, colors have a warm look to them , the whites are not as blue looking as my Samsung phones screen. IT is a full 5.5 inch display, and yes the buttons are on screen, But can go away in certain apps, to give you the full screen to use, like when watching videos for instance. the sound is very good, although it only has one front facing speaker at the top. it is loud and clear. Call quality has been excellent, and when calling an iphone 6, about two or three feet away, with both phones on speaker. the Moto G4 Plus had no signs of feedback, or echoing, indicating it does an excellent job of noise cancellation. the iphone 6 however sounded like a horror movie. The UI (user interface) is slick and basic android. fast and responsive. the Moto gestures work well as far as the double twist for camera, and the double chop for flashlight. I have not tested the others yet. Supposedly this phone is Water and dust resistant, but i will not be testing that, for obvious reasons. The camera seems to be great so far, low light photos look pretty good, and there is even a pro mode that lets you tweak all the aspects of the camera. if you hold down the shoot button, it takes photos in rapid succession, pretty cool feature. This phone also lets you record slow motion videos which is fun. Some of the cons of this phone i can think of, are: No NFC, not a big deal to me personally, because I never plan on using android pay anytime soon at least, and I never bump my phone to share stuff with other people. I've had NFC on past phones for years, and never used it, except to try it out to see if it worked. No Magnetometer / Compass. I'm not sure of the full implications of not having a compass are, but GPS and navigation still work, because they rely on the GPS sensors, this phone also uses GLONASS, which is just the Russian version of the United states GPS system, twice as many satellites, means twice the reliability, and more accurate and faster positioning. Since there is no Compass, google sky map will not work correctly, which is big bummer for me. ON THE OVER HEATING ISSUE: I live in south Texas, and tested this phone outside with the camera app, taking dozens of photos and using CPU-Z i never noticed temps over 55 C on any of the sensors, most were about 50 C or below. also the camera app never started lagging and stuttering. I will update this review if anything changes, and after a month or two when i have spent more time with the phone. EDIT: after using this phone for 4 days now. I bumped it from a 4 to a 5 star. The battery life is very good. And easily last all day. In fact I've had the phone with me at work now since 7 am this morning, using it off and on pretty often. It is now 2:30 pm and I still have 70% left. Pretty impressive. The screen looks great in full sun with full brightness setting, no problems at all.

B071ZDQ6MV,Joseph C. Henricks,5,"August 3, 2017",True,A feature by feature break down.,"I am going to step you through each aspect of the phone and my thoughts so far. Short Version Pro's - Price is seems very low for what you get. - Battery life is shockingly good. (ha) - Phone feels amazing in the hand, the one piece of aluminum shell can't be beat - Durability of this thing is on point, designed to last instead of break. - Speaker sounds great and achieves good volume. - Bare bones android, the dream. - Comprehensive antenna set for travel. Con's - No usb C connector, uses the more common micro usb. - Stock camera software is extremely basic, enough for most users but weak for those looking for those great shots. - Processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it's barely noticeable. - Phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection. - It doesn't make me breakfast. Feel and buttons: The phone feels extremely high quality, it's the only phone that I really hate having a case on because the aluminum feels so nice. The power and volume buttons are also aluminum and very solid, there have been complaints about them being hard to press, they aren't, they are just stiff enough that you won't easily accidentally press them like all other phones. Touch screen and fingerprint sensor: The screen felt a little off to me and it doesn't register touch perfectly but it's on par with other flag ship phones I've owned and I am still just getting use to it. The finger print sensor on this phone is amazing, it is covered with durable glass and reads finger prints very well. If you have issues with it re-enter your print, when I did it worked great. Battery: Holy crap, I've never, ever, had a phone that lasts like this one with the stock battery, my previous phone had an extended battery that more then doubled it's capacity and this phone doesn't drain much faster then it did. Charges reasonably quick and doesn't turn into a fire brick while charging and doing tasks. Camera: Ok, so my last phone had an amazing manual mode with full shudder speed controls and the works. This one comes with a stock android camera app that is pretty weak for features and merely ok at capturing good shots. Apps like open camera help resolve this but it's a little bit buggy on this phone, especially when trying to control shudder speed. I can't speak a lot to the selfie camera because I don't really use them. Speaker: How does something this cheap have speakers this good? I don't have an answer, I'm just really happy it does. It's not super loud, it reaches about average volume, but does it with rich sound for a phone. Software: Stock android, no bloat other then the amazon apps but who isn't using prime? The ads are very easy to ignore and I'll gladly ignore an ad for 50 dollars, I honestly don't even notice them. Antenna's/Travel: One of the reasons I purchased this phone is because I am spending some time in Europe and it has, by far, the most comprehensive LTE antenna setup for the cost. I searched forever trying to find a phone with the 3,7,20 bands for Europe, I was struggling to find flag ship phones that had it and here it is on a entry level. Durability: The Youtuber JerryRigEverything said this may be his pick for most durable phone of 2017. I could have guessed that when it arrived. If you look closely at the phone you can see the spacer built between the screen and the outer edge of the phone, creating a bumper to help protect it. A thin rubber case is enough to make this phone very unlikely to be damaged. Even if you fall victim to the the very satisfying feel of this phone without a case you'd have to give it a pretty harsh drop to crack it. If I think of anything else I'll edit the review later, if you have questions comment on this review and I'll try to address them. Finding the right phone to fit your situation can be tough but I believe this particular phone can fit nicely into most peoples situations.",690.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0,"A feature by feature break down.

B00MWI4HW0,Amazon Customer,5,"September 19, 2014",True,Quick review from an owner. US GSM 8gb MotoG gen2 black.,"I wanted to provide a quick review for the Moto G 2nd Gen. Specific model is the US GSM Black 8gb. I purchased this for my wife here on Amazon. We use AT&T and I wanted to replace my wife's aging iPhone4 off contract. This is the best phone for the price I found. I charged the phone, inserted her AT&T sim card from her iphone4, inserted the 16gb micro sd card (can use up to 32gb), and everything worked flawlessly. Pros: lovely 5"" screen, quick and responsive touch, perfect size screen, Gorilla Glass! micro-usb charging (common), stock Android Kit Kat, upgradeable to Android L when released, MicroSD card slot, front stereo speakers, great call quality, great reception, price, unlocked (great for travel), no contract! Blutooth and Wifi work fine. No issues connecting to our home network and my wifes work wifi. Cons: No 4GLTE, Non Removable battery, No included headset/ear buds, LIMITED accessories so far(cases) Build Quality: Nothing to complain about. Perfect weight, feels solid, very tight, does NOT feel flimsy. The back phone cover is easily swappable. The black color is a deep matte black. Not slippery hard plastic, but a more rubberized feel. Battery life is very good. Not stellar, but easily lasts a complete day for my wife who is a average smartphone user. I just wish the battery was replaceable to increase longevity of the phone. This phone is perfect for the non-power user, average user, someone new to android, or is replacing their phone off contract. The specs are slightly above average for a phone in this price category! It is an amazing phone for under $200 off contract. 4G LTE would have been greatly appreciated, but it is not necessary because my wife's iphone 4 never had it either (and she is almost always connected to wifi anyways). I personally use the flagship LG G3 on AT&T (another AMAZING phone). so I set everything up for my wife (iphone4 user). I imported her contacts from her iphone which was simple after watching a few youtube videos on how to do it. Just search on youtube ""iPhone to Android Contact list"". The entire process after watching the video took 2 minutes lol. Of course this phone cannot compare to my LG G3, BUT, I was very impressed with this MotoG 2nd Gen. Contents: Box, Manuals, phone, and charging cable with plug. It is a wall plug with long microusb cable attached to the plug itself. Basically the wall plug adapter and the microusb cable cannot be separated. It is built as one single unit. NOTE* If you live in the UNITED STATES, buy the US GSM version. The Global version will work fine.... BUT the US GSM version is better suited for US cellular signals. I can confirm this phone works perfectly with AT&T and should work perfectly with T-mobile. I would order this phone again in a heartbeat for my wife. She loves it. I hope this review helps! ****Minor Update**** This phone continues to impress me. The screen is very bright and the colors are vivid and punchy. The screen resolution is more than adequate, it is very similar to the iphone 4 retina display. If you look closely, you can barely see pixels. Don't worry, the screen is very sharp and small text can be read with ease. After playing with the phone for over 12 hours, installing apps, configuring the phone, browsing the web, facebook, spotify, etc.. I still show 30% battery remaining from a full charge this morning! This was an intensive day of usage setting everything up. I easily downloaded 20+ apps, and probably 100 songs on spotify. , Do not be concerned about the lack of ""dual sim"". Unless you are a frequent traveler going overseas this is not an important feature. Dual sim is used so that when traveling, you can buy a foreign sim card and insert it into your phone without needing to remove your primary sim card (hence, dual sim). With this single sim US GSM model, just remove your sim and swap it out for the foreign sim card, no big deal. Just don't lose your primary sim card lol. *********************",658.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G (2nd generation) Unlocked Cellphone, 8GB, Black",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-2nd-generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00MWI4HW0,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OLIW5q0eL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00MWI4HW0,3,99.0,0.0,"Quick review from an owner.

B00F2SKPIM,Critical Reviewer,5,"October 14, 2013",False,I really was reluctant to purchase a Samsung device but then all that changed,"All right here is an honest review about the note 3. It's something that I will approach from the perspective of someone in the Medical field, who needs to get things done quickly, and efficiently. First of all, I received my phone on October 10th, and I had pre-ordered it but DID NOT pay 299. Well initially I did, but there is a promo code of VERIZON30 that drops the note 3 down to 209.99. I bought the Note 3 for myself and the LG G2 for my wife. Needless to say, at the price of 139.99 for the G2 and 209.99 for the Note 3, we returned the G2 for the note 3 despite the G2's incredible low light camera performance. Here is why. Backstory: prior to buying the note 3 I have had the Droid Razr Maxx, which for its time was a great device. Now that apps are becoming more memory intensive, something needed to change. I needed a phone that wouldn't lag on me, and I really don't care about gimmicks such as scrolling while looking up or down, or pausing a video if I look away. Who really cares about that stuff? If I want to pause, I tap on the screen, which is less time consuming that looking away and ensuring my phone has paused playing a video. In addition, I really don't want that front facing camera on unless I am using it. Also, I was always reluctant to buy a Samsung phone because of the plastic build, but you know I always keep my phone in a safe case. I will talk about this a little later. Now, right before I let go of my razr maxx, I briefly upgraded to the note 2 for 2 days. I chose the note 2 because I was in best buy and was comparing the HTC ONE which best buy had on sale for $50 and all of a sudden I decided to listen to the note 2's speaker. I was blown away in comparison to the razr maxx, but blown away which how much more I got in comparison to the HTC one. We are all going to large screens now, and frankly who the heck wants to hold the phone closer to their face? I certainly don't so I upgraded to the note 2. I really did not fall in love with it until the day I was sitting in my senior human cadaver anatomy course, and realized I had forgotten my Anatomy atlas and my notebook. I frantically searched the note 2 and found an app called S Note. I opened S note and began using it. I was blow away, there are blood vessels that are large and really thing, and I used to be able to only differentiate that on paper. Not this time, with the note 2 I was able to use the thin and thick lines as differentiators thanks to the S-pen. I then made my decision that I would return the note 2 and wait for the note 3 because of the larger screen, and faster processor. In addition, I had a memory intensive Anatomy app running on the note 2 that smoothly ran it, when my HP touchpad running android decided to begin hiccupping. Now with all that said, this is why I feel the note 3 is the best choice on the market. First of all, if your going to purchase a phone that you are spending your hard earned money on it, it should be in the most secure and safest cases. It's an investment, that when 2 years later you sell back, you can almost pay for your new device. Second of all, we will ALL drop our phones at SOME POINT, and its important to protect them. I purchased the Spigen Bounce case despite it being slightly ugly; I got the gray one because Incipio NGP tpu cases are NOT yet available for this phone. That case kept my razr maxx in like new condition. Now, I really protect my phone because I have my entire life on it, my class schedule, my hospital schedule, my family schedule, my kids doctors appointments, my appointments, my tests etc. EVERYTHING. So I needed a phone that was behind me 100% and never let me down. It has been the case with the note 3. I have customized it and it still hasn't hiccupped yet. Now the actual review: Screen & Productivity: The large display is fantastic. It is large enough to hold a full month calendar on one home screen and 3 days on another. I absolutely love the vivid screen because my anatomy apps, as well as using it to take notes is an absolute breeze. My only recommendation is to add many pages before you begin in lecture or whatever you want to take notes in. There are many times where I find inspirational quotes on Facebook (FB) and wish I could save them and tag them to share not via FB but text messages etc. Scrap book has allowed me to do just that, I can share inspirational quotes and pictures with anyone and it's a breeze to look them up by placing my OWN PERSONAL tags for each photo. I hold the menu button, type inspiration and BAM; I have all my things that are tagged inspirational. Sometimes I also need a list of diagnostic medical conditions, and it's easy to quickly create a scrapbook memo or create a flow chart in S-note. Etc. In fact the other day, I was talking to Verizon and needed to write down the conformational code etc. for my second note 3, and you know what I did? I was on the dialer page, pulled out the S-pen and circled the page, then I notated it with all the information, it contains the date, the time, and all the information I need to have in case something went awry. I absolutely love this feature and it is very important. Another feature I love is that when I am on YouTube, I can load HD very quickly, the LG g2 did a good job in this too, but the razr maxx despite being an LTE phone did not handle this very well. Another thing I really love on this phone straight out of the gate is that it tells me how many text messages I have (like an unread count). Its something I like, it also has many accounts built right in, such as amazon, Facebook etc. I was able to disable most of the bloat ware by going to manage applications and clicking disable in some of the pre-loaded Verizon apps. The IR blaster is great, I've already started using it on all my TV's however, it wont turn the volume up on my LG TV but do every else. In addition, I am able to have in memory which room has which TV and so when I switch rooms, I also switch rooms on my phone, which allows me to use it as a remote. Great when you have to hide the remote from your little ones. Battery Life: Used it for an entire day hardcore, and its still at 31% at the end of the day after about 6 am to 1 am usage. UPDATE 10.23.13- see the attached screen shot of battery usage. I was pretty impressed. I do know for a fact though that S- health eats battery life like crazy. Also I LOVE the speaker placement on the bottom of the phone, because it's just smart. When I hold my phone, it cups around the speaker channeling the sound directly to me, and not the entire audience behind my phone. Smart. People have complained about the flip board app, but keep in mind, this is android and not IOS. We have choices here. Download an app called home 2 shortcut and it allowed me to configure double tapping the home button to start Google now rather than anything else. Its fantastic and a great use of android capabilities. (I will update more here) The S-pen I received was faulty with my phone, and so Verizon sent me a brand new one for free. Not taking off stars for that, during the pre-order stage stuff like that happens every once in a while. The Spen was completely usable I just had to add a little extra pressure. But no worries, it's taken care of and all is well. The power button has a slight lag when you just tap it to turn on the screen; if you give it a robust tap it comes on quicker. It is quickest to turn on the screen using the home button when it's sleeping. It kind of irritates me that it is that way. NOTE 10.23.13 It maybe quicker to use the HOME button to do the same thing. I wish Samsung allowed customization of the LED colors for the types of notifications. Note 10.23.13 Re: reception issues- I know people have complained about reception issues, but truly I haven't had many. Just a couple here and there. I think the reality is that the Note 3 is SLOW at switching networks etc. So rather than wait, I have just downloaded a refresh network app, which does what I need in less than 15 seconds and gives me a fresh connection. I don't see it as much of an inconvenience especially because the many positives of this device outweigh this one negative. I haven't had no reception anywhere. Tethering by the has been pretty amazingly fast with this phone, and it DOES NOT GET HOT!!!! I love that! My razr maxx used to be a meteorite when it was tethering. More to come. UPDATE 12.13.13 I apologize it has been a while to update. I absolutely still love this phone, and I wouldnt change much about my review. I will say that I have experience reception issues but they are SOOO SELDOM, I believe ive refreshed the network about 4-5 times since I have wrote the initial review and now. Ive been informed that there IS an app that allows you to customize the colors of the LED to what you want. Excellent, so thats definitely a negative taken away. I had been using my phone with a Spigen screen protector and initially I liked it, but now with using the S-pen and it aging I really am beginning to dislike that screen protector. I have just ordered a tempered glass screen protector and will update later about that. ONE thing I have learned is to save EVERYTHING from action memo to Scrapbook or S-Note if you want to hold onto it in case your phone needs to be reset. I had to reset my phone once, but it was due to the FoxFi app and it causing certificate issues. Once I reset it it fixed it. Another note, the Spigen case protector I was talking about, it is great, however I have found that the squared edges make it uncomfortable for my hand to hold, when I remove the case I can handle the phone pretty easily with one hand (even though I have hands on the smaller side). So I have ordered a case that has rounded edges rather than squared edges. Whatever you do, do NOT get a metal case for your phone because it will reduce your signal quality. Other than that the phone has been running great, and I will update it again soon!",597.0,Samsung,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00F2SKPIM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eFtaIWpcL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00F2SKPIM,983,0.0,0.0,"I really was reluctant to purchase a Samsung device but then all that changed All right here is an honest review about the note 3. It's something that I will approach from the perspective of someone in the Medical field, who needs to get things done quickly, and efficiently. First of all, I received my phone on October 10th, and I had pre-ordered it but DID NOT pay 299. Well initially I did, but there is a promo code of VERIZON30 that drops the note 3 down to 209.99. I bought the Note 3 for myself and the LG G2 for my wife. Needless to say, at the price of 139.99 for the G2 and 209.99 for the Note 3, we returned the G2 for the note 3 despite the G2's incredible low light camera performance. Here is why. Backstory: prior to buying the note 3 I have had the Droid Razr Maxx, which for its time was a great device. Now that apps are becoming more memory intensive, something needed to change. I needed a phone that wouldn't lag on me, and I really don't care about gimmicks such as scrolling while looking up or down, or pausing a video if I look away. Who really cares about that stuff? If I want to pause, I tap on the screen, which is less time consuming that looking away and ensuring my phone has paused playing a video. In addition, I really don't want that front facing camera on unless I am using it. Also, I was always reluctant to buy a Samsung phone because of the plastic build, but you know I always keep my phone in a safe case. I will talk about this a little later. Now, right before I let go of my razr maxx, I briefly upgraded to the note 2 for 2 days.

B0791VS3N9,ruel,5,"March 12, 2018",True,Beautiful Powerful Huawei Mate SE is the phone to get,"bought the GOLD version of this Huawei Mate SE for $229 + sales tax from here on amazon. as an iPhone person who recently turned to Huawei, this is a fabulous great phone from Huawei. my iPhone was flaking out because of apple's horrible battery shutdown/slowdown problems. apple jumped the shark trying to fool people about what was really happening with iPhone batteries. anyways, previously got a nice AT&T-branded Huawei Ascend XT2 which was like my training-wheels version to get me ready for this much more powerful unlocked Huawei Mate SE. Huawei got me hooked with its EMUI 5.1 (based on Android 7.0) that is designed to kinda be reminiscent of the iPhone iOS, particularly when you turn off the app drawer, but still a powerful android. so switching to the new Huawei Mate SE was easy peasy. and having 4GB RAM and 64GB storage really helped a lot to make the phone much more comfortable to use without worrying about lack of memory or lack of space. oh, in comparison, looking at the Huawei Honor 7x here on amazon, but for a little bit more in price, the Huawei Mate SE is the definite better buy. both the Huawei Honor 7x and the Huawei Mate SE look the same but the major difference is the Huawei Mate SE is more powerful with the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. and the Huawei Mate SE is available in a GOLD version. my preferred phone gold color version. yea! definite no brainer. got the Huawei Mate SE. myself originally coming from iPhone, my suggestion to others regarding apps to make the transition in finding very good equivalent apps to iPhone's iMessages, Find My iPhone, and Find My Friends, is to go to the Google Play Store to download WhatsApp, Find My Device (from google), and Family Locator GPS Tracker (from Life360). and if you are like me thinking the android app drawer is a bit bothersome, well, you can turn it off in the settings on this Huawei phone. hopefully this advice should get you started if you want to have a more iphone-like experience on a Huawei phone. my journey is complete moving from iPhone to android where this Huawei Mate SE has become my primary phone. using this phone on AT&T and have 4G LTE. the Wi-Fi is only regular 2.5GHz wifi -- without the 5GHz wifi option (the Huawei Ascend XT2 has both 2.5GHz wifi and 5GHz wifi) but that's just fine if all your WiFi access is mostly to regular 2.5GHz wifi wherever you go and wherever you happen to be. personally still carry an iPhone as a backup phone in my go bag, but this Huawei Mate SE is my main phone now. went through other android phones, then recently got the aforementioned Huawei Ascend XT2, and now have this absolutely beautiful gorgeous Huawei Mate SE. physically very iphone-like and almost similar to the iPhone 7+ with the metal body plus with the dual camera on the back in the top corner like on the iPhone 8+ and then with the more modern 18:9 size front screen like on the iPhone X but without the iPhoneX ugly notch. also this Huawei Mate SE has a real must-have earphone jack. and this absolutely beautiful powerful phone performs smoothly with no lag. and Huawei seems to be hinting that Android 8 and most likely a newer EMUI are on the way for this and other Huawei phones for sometime during March 2018 or whenever. [edit: Honor 7x beta testing Android 8 and EMUI 8 began March 15. with maybe possible full release in April? (because news also reports Honor India says April for official release.) Huawei Mate SE should presumedly also get the android8 upgrade in the same timeframe sometime soonish whenever thereabouts is my guess....] so this phone will get even better with huawei support. yes, this Huawei Mate SE is very satisfactory. very happy with this phone. PS: people have commented in other reviews that if you turn on bluetooth, then the Wi-Fi slows down. this has particularly been reported in amazon reviews for the Honor 7x, and at least one other person mentioned it in a review here for the Huawei Mate SE. so, did a speed test to see what happens with my Huawei Mate SE on my home wifi internet: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had 47Mbps wifi internet speed; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had 31Mbps wifi internet speed. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is reportedly owned by Netflix). okay this is with an ARRIS TG2472G cable modem with built-in WiFi that can handle both 2.5GHz and 5GHz, but only 2.5GHz is relevant for the Huawei Mate SE, where my home internet is on the Cox Internet Preferred 100 Plan, and so my plan's internet speed can be as high as 100Mbps on the 5GHz side but typically half that on the 2.5GHz side. of course, we are only concerned with the 2.5GHz wifi. turning on bluetooth and getting 30+ Mbps wifi internet speed doesn't matter in a noticeable way to me on my home internet plan. however, if your home internet is much slower like on a basic starter plan with a maximum speed of 10Mbps or less, then proportionally any decreased wifi speed with bluetooth turned on could possibly be noticeable to you. sorry, if you are a big bluetooth user. me not use an android gear watch or bluetooth earphones. if you really don't use bluetooth, then keep the BT off and this issue won't matter to you when you are on wifi. but if you are out away from home trying to use free wifi which can be congested or which may have throttled speeds already, then this BT issue could affect you -- and so maybe just use cellular data in that situation if you really need your BT. personally, this BT issue is not a deal killer for me. this is a great phone imho. PSS: okay maybe the bluetooth-wifi issue is a load of hooey. tried testing wifi internet speed with the bluetooth turned on while on the Wi-Fi at my parents' home where they have a DLink 2.5GHz wifi router and where my folks are on the Cox basic starter internet plan that has an advertised max speed of 10Mbps: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had wifi internet speeds of 9.8Mbps and 11Mbps; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had wifi internet speeds of 8.4Mbps and 10Mbps. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is owned by Netflix). it's like no difference whether bluetooth is turn on or off as to the effect on wifi. but other real life factors could be involved -- that's for any picky bluetooth users to test, such as also using their particular bluetooth devices, because at this point, this so-called bluetooth-wifi issue is a non-issue for me. but my guess is if there is any effect, then it's a combination of your wifi router and/or your bluetooth device(s). (yeah, have previously seen differences in using a bluetooth speaker on my macbook versus on my iphone.) in other words, YMMV. bottomline as far as the Huawei Mate SE goes, get the phone, and if you are like me then you'll most likely love the phone. Another PS: (03/29/2018) just got the latest android security patch dated March 1, 2018 for the android 7 on this Huawei Mate SE. this is update version B130. it's not android 8 yet. comments elsewhere over on the xda-developer forum indicate that testing for android 8 (and also presumedly emui 8) on Huawei Mate SE may occur after testing is finished for the Honor7x. my guess at this point is to expect beta testing in April(?) or May(?) with official final distribution sometime soonish afterwards?? just have to wait and see. okay yeah would love to right now have android 8 (with treble to allow for more timely updates?), but this Huawei Mate SE, with android 7.0 and EMUI 5.1, plus with the latest android security update, is a very good reasonably up-to-date secure phone. my bottomline recommendation still stands to say this Huawei Mate SE is definitely a great phone very much worth getting. Yet Another PS (04/17/2018): GSMARENA indicates that Huawei Honor 7x to get EMUI 8, based on Android 8, to officially roll out with final release in May 2018. so maybe beta testing of Android 8 & EMUI 8 for Huawei Mate SE will occur sometime thereafter? could be looking at June/July for official final release on Huawei Mate SE is my current guess?? we'll see.... meanwhile, me currently still very happy with my Huawei Mate SE. oh, an app tip for those who use their Huawei Mate SE in the car: if you need a car app for playing your music and handling your calls & texts while driving, myself using the DRIVEMODE free app (found in the google play store). imho, it's better than Android Auto. can activate & turn off Drivemode from notifications, and overlay Drivemode on top of the music app, plus easy swipes & taps to control my tunes, and big buttons for answering calls & texts as well as voice control to answer calls and to read/answer texts. (oh, with the overlay, you may want to fully increase screen brightness & turn off the eye comfort.) drivemode works great with my whatsapp also. and particularly, the bigger controls (swipe or tap anywhere on the screen) makes it easy to manage my music tunes while driving, kinda sorta like on my old iphone, but different & better on my Huawei Mate SE which is usually docked on the dashboard of my car when me out driving. hope you all are enjoying your Huawei Mate SE (or soon will be if you are looking to get one). Still Yet Another PS (05/09/2018): there are discussion messages over on XDA-Developers that indicate an Over-The-Air update to Android 8.0 is being pushed out in batches to Huawei Mate SE. the batches are apparently randomly sent out and so you may not get it right away. still hasn't shown up on mine yet. sounds like minor changes, but have to wait to see. good luck and enjoy your Huawei Mate SE. PS Update (May 11, 2018): finally got the Android 8.0 & EMUI 8.0 update. see attached picture. if you have a Huawei Mate SE, you should also be getting this update. yes, this is the phone worth getting. Thanks, Huawei! ADDENDUM: after updating to Android 8.0 (EMUI 8.0), some apps like Swarm, Yelp, weather apps, etc may not show maps inside those apps and may instead state an error message stuck on saying: Google Play Services are updating. you have to clear the data for Google Play Services in the settings app. Settings > Google > Location > Google Play services > Storage > and then clear both Cache (Clear Cache) and Data (Manage Data > Clear All Data) -- and that should fix the maps inside apps.",594.0,HUAWEI,Huawei Mate SE Factory Unlocked 5.93” - 4GB/64GB Octa-core Processor| 16MP + 2MP Dual Camera| GSM Only |Grey (US Warranty),https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Mate-Factory-Unlocked-5-93/dp/B0791VS3N9,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/811cPuY63mL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0791VS3N9,2,349.99,0.0,"Beautiful Powerful Huawei Mate SE is the phone to get bought the GOLD version of this Huawei Mate SE for $229 + sales tax from here on amazon. as an iPhone person who recently turned to Huawei, this is a fabulous great phone from Huawei. my iPhone was flaking out because of apple's horrible battery shutdown/slowdown problems. apple jumped the shark trying to fool people about what was really happening with iPhone batteries. anyways, previously got a nice AT&T-branded Huawei Ascend XT2 which was like my training-wheels version to get me ready for this much more powerful unlocked Huawei Mate SE.

B01D1J9BGU,Cam,5,"March 30, 2016",True,Best Phone currently on the Market - Includes International Version Details,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago. A lot of people have asked questions about this particular international version so I'll answer some of those first. For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app ""Shaid"" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a ""Hijri dates adjustment"" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging. This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers. To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine. Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm). The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram. Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone: - If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher. - This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for ""Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings"" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements. - ""Edge functionality"" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off. Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge. Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera. Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance. Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =) A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything.",580.0,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935FD 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-GALAXY-INTERNATIONAL-VERSION-WARRANTY/dp/B01D1J9BGU,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ap4Pp+y0L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01D1J9BGU,783,399.0,0.0,"Best Phone currently on the Market - Includes International Version Details I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago.

B07Q2X19LG,Peazfool,5,"April 20, 2019",False,Comparison shopping vs the Samsung s10e and the s10.,"So I've been in the market for a new phone since I have a Samsung s7 and it's getting slower. I have been looking at the flagship phones - Huawei p30 pro, p30, Samsung s10E, S10, S10+ and even the Samsung s9+, I've looked at the side by sides and the Huawei wins. Here's why - 1. Huawei has the bigger battery, (battery run tests show in order of phones dying after same usage: 6. Samsung 10e, 5. Samsung S10, 4. Samsung S9+ 3. Huawei p30. 2. Huawei p30 Pro. 1. Samsung S10+. This was a bit of a shocker because I thought Huawei pro has a bigger battery than the 10+, but the test showed better performance by the Samsung. 2. Price - The Huawei p30 pro and the Samsung 10+ are are both out of my price range. The only major difference between the p30 Pro and the P30 is the P30 pro has wireless charging (which replaces a headphone jack), a bigger camera sensor, superior telephoto lens, bigger battery, and better display. For me - I don't personally like huge phones that don't fit in my pocket, I also don't like the 300 dollar price difference, I furthermore don't care about wireless charging, AND I really want a headphone jack. So for me - the P30, the S10 and the S10e made more sense to buy. 3. Now when it comes to photos, the results are very mixed. For the price, the Samsung s9+ is the best camera/price combo out of all of these, the difference between the S9+ and the S10 are very minimal to me. The colors look more true on the S9 than the S10s for some reason. There's a youtube video comparing these cameras in low-light conditions and even I was shocked that I (along with others who saw the video) picked the S9+ over the S10s. (But again, i dont like bulky phones, so s9+ is out) HOWEVER, the Huawei p30 and p30 pro low-light camera is INDUSTRY LEADING, better than the S10, better than the Pixel 3 (Although Pixel 3 has more true-to-life colors), and Apple (is not even worth a mention here tbh, it's so sad how far they have fallen behind, and how dumb their followers truly are - sorry Apple fans). So because of price, I narrowed it down to the Samsung 10e and the Huawei p30. The Huawei p30 is cheaper that the 10e, which really makes it a no brainer for me. (Right now, the S10E with student discount is $634 (with tax) on Samsung website) and P30 is 599 here and other websites (do your research) with no tax. The p30 has better battery, faster charging, better looks, and superior low-light performance than the S10E - So it's a no brainer I am opting the buy the P30. Added comment 1 wk post-purchase: 1. The Huawei product is not a product of the Chinese government, that's a rumor started in the USA, and only in the USA. I believe it's used to protect Apple's share in the market. US could potentially be Huawei's biggest market, but trade war stuff and politics prevents the US government from allowing Huawei phones to be carried by major carriers. Europe, Canada, Latin America and Asia all have Huawei phones, zero countries have discovered any sort of spying hardware or software. The company itself will overtake Samsung or so as the 2nd largest phone company in the world. I did my research thoroughly and stand firm on the results. Any comments to the contrary is either under-researched or not researched. But as a precaution - Huawei ID does ask for access to your information (same as Samsung, same as Apple ID) I opted out of joining the Huawei ID and have no problems - by the way you can't do this on an Apple. 2. Low light amazingness only happens when you take pictures in 40 mp, at 10 mp, the performance is similar to my Samsung s7 edge. Yes, the low light performance is amazing. As expected, daylight pictures are a little cooler than the Samsung photos I've taken. 3. I don't like how all the apps are on your home screen, so I put them all in folders on a third home screen and never scroll there. 4. This phone doesn't have wireless charging, so also by default - no reverse wireless charging. The p30 Pro has that capability. 5. Holy crap this phone is fast - no Google maps load time, faster load times on games than Samsung s10s, when you're on Google maps and you take a wrong turn, the phone immediately recalculates route and gives you new directions, this is especially important when you're in a rush and are looking up directions somewhere, my old Samsung s7 drove me nuts with the load times, and I've missed secondary turns from direction reloading. I got lost in an Uber going to the airport before due to this issue, Uber driver had to pull off to the shoulder for my map to load because her map wasn't showing directions properly. I am relieved this will never happen again. 6. Battery life performance was great as expected - I'm a heavy user and get to 39% at the end of the night. This is super important because when you go out, you have the capacity to take a bunch of pictures, even after all day (heavy) use. This would never happen on an Apple or Samsung phone of equivalent size. 7. P30 uses new technology for your ear, it's not a speaker. It's some sort of ultrasonic vibration. I've heard reviews of it not working as well as the speakers but I found this unfounded, I've noticed no difference in sound quality of calls. However, I did notice differences when the other person put me on speaker. Sometimes they sound really muffled. This problem only existed when i called friends in california (2x this happened with 2 different people) 8. The operating system took zero time for me to learn, some things this phone does better than Apple, some it doesn't. Apple IOS is still Imo, most intuitive. I've had zero issues with app compatibility since p30 runs android. I ran into one problem with Whatsapp and thought it was a compatibility issue, turns out it was a permission I didn't give the app. Problem solved in no time. I will continue to update this review over time. 3 weeks post purchase - the p30 has a problem with the fingerprint sensor going on and off every 10 seconds. This has been a wide ranging problem as seen on the Huawei forums. The US officially banned Huawei (along with Australia, Japan and Taiwan) but the list of countries that don't ban Huawei (because of the potential 5g rollout) includes: most of Europe since Vodafone publically defends Huawei, India, Vietnam, most of South America, Russia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Indonesia. As of 6/27/19 - the fingerprint issue has been fixed, but Google no longer will support Huawei devices. I am not 100% clear how this will affect the phone but the plus side is this trade war might be over soon, once that's all done this phone is a steal. I did a comparison with the Pixel 3 night time, and had minimal difference, my phone did pick up some colors better, definitely better exposure, but completely missed the light purple colors for some reason at night (it comes out as blue) . If that's your favorite color for some reason, you might not want to pick this over the pixel 3. Update 10/1/19 - Trade war still happening, nothing has happened to Google Play store, or any andriod feature. Since Google announced they won't be supporting Huawei, Huawei has declared to build their own operating system, so that should be interesting. This phone battery never dies, not once has this phone ever died because of battery. I've timed it so I charge my phone at work every day or so. When I take this phone out of the little case, the aurura blue is still gorgeous. People think it's the Apple 11 lmao. The 40 megapixel makes drop dead gorgeous 8 x 10 photos which Wal Mart Photo develops nicely. (I've done my research on this, don't go to CVS, Walgreens, etc their photo machines and print quality are trash). No issues with not registering Huawei ID. Zero compatibility issues with apps. This is probably my last update until major changes happen with the trade war or Huawei rolls out with a new operating system.

B07R7DY911,CynicalBubble2,5,"May 15, 2019",False,Overall Good Value,"This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price. Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack. Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included. I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it). However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices. I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer. I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful! Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!) New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together. Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost.

B07C65XFBB,Mr. Peas,5,"June 26, 2018",True,Wicked Smart Review. 7-Year Apple user. Not anymore.,"🔫Note: This review will be updated numerous times as the phone ages. And be jealous of my green laser gun. Service Provider: STRAIGHT TALK Apple only user (7 years) BACKGROUND: My iPhone 5s went to poo 💩(For the second time in 7 years I lost an iPhone). Each time the ""geniuses"" told me my phone was not repairable and I had to buy a new phone. AND both times it was the charge connector that just went completely crap one day. Great. Looking back I guess I was part of the many brainwashed sheep with the one track mind thinking Apple leads all. But in reality, they are stuck in neutral. Since they lost Steve Jobs, no one has stepped up to be that Willy Wonka of cutting edge ideas and showmanship. And its blatantly obvious to me now. Oh and guess what? They now make the headphones use the same failure prone adapter on all new iPhones (meaning you cannot wire charge and listen to headphones), so I finally decided to stop eating rotten Apples. And I decided to Hitchhike a Ride on a Galaxy S9. Now I know you'll say a 5s is older and its comparing apples and oranges (that pun was unintentional🤮...my apoligies), but my friend has an iPhone X and let me try it. It wasn't that much different of an Apple experience. And it was 400 more than this phone. (I apologize for my overt digressions, but phones are a huge investment and I try to make my reviews thorough and whatever the perfect opposite of boring is...I hope.) Day 1: I'm really $%@!$& nervous. Did I make the right decision? I'm a textbook overthinker. I went without a phone for 9 days trying to decide. And here I am. Waiting on a refurbished Galaxy S9. Finally Delivered. First box is the typical smaller Amazon box. Second inside is a small white box. Very simple worry-free packaging. Inside that box was the phone, A/C adaptor, charge cord, and a paper with quickstart and APN help. Also a card from Amazon saying contact the seller first with a problem blah blah Charlie Brown teacher voice blah blah blah. So I have made a few certified refurbished electronic purchases in the past and they worked out great, so I was not as apprehensive as maybe a refurb greenhorn might be. But listen. Phone is in hand now. And this phone is stunning. Immaculate. I went over it and it looks COMPLETELY brand new. The screen is perfect. Don't be afraid. Jump in the water. Buy refurbished. Ok...so here is my first negative, but its petty really. I bought the ""lilac"" colored phone because I love light colored purples like lilac and lavender. Only this isn't really either. I'd call this more of a pinker color with a hint of purple, but its still sleek and nice and can be covered up with a case if needed. Ok so physical condition out of the box I'd give a solid grade A+ Now for the SIM card. Again I am a Straight Talk user (looooove them...4 years strong now). My iPhone has been tanked and off for about 9 days. I popped out the SIM card from the rotten phone, popped out the Samsung SIM tray and dropped in the SIM, pushing the tray back flush. Powered the phone on. Without going through every single step, the setup was so easy and seamless. It automatically found my service provider, so I would say this is pretty much as close to plug and play as you can get. So awesome. I am falling hard like Pete for Ariana for this phone... Well...I've been playing with the phone for a few hours now. I cannot put it down. So many things are infinitely better than Apple. I'm going to list a few and stop the review for Day 1. And if you made it this far, peace and love neighbor. Happy phone hunting. You're beautiful🌞🌜⛱🌚🌟 1. Customization: THEMES! I can't stop trying these out. They change the sounds and wallpapers and App icons and probably other cool stuff I don't realize all at once. They are so cool. Text messages look different. And the wallpapers can be animated. Lock screens can be videos. I am admittedly geeking a little. Android systems let you change soooooooo much. And I am a customization freak. Not only can you choose from hundreds of free and paid themes on the Google Play store, but you can choose from so many different fonts as well (and you can choose from tons for free and money the same way). You can set the order of so many things, it's just the coolest. Oh and here is a great one. For the OCD users like me, who hated when you couldn't delete an apple app, you still have those on Android you cannot delete as well. BUT YOU CAN HIDE THEM! 2. The button clicks are addictive. It feels like you are pushing a button when its the bare screen. I have a screen protector on AND and phone case and it's still extremely responsive. 3. The swiping motions aren't that different from Apple. I'm navigating like a pro. I'm sure there are how-to videos I need to watch to learn all of the shortcuts, but I'm doing just fine. Ok. Enough for now. I'm jonesing to play with the phone waaaaaay more. Ask any questions you want. I will answer all I can. I will update this review as I see the need.

Ok so physical condition out of the box I'd give a solid grade A+ Now for the SIM card. Again I am a Straight Talk user (looooove them...4 years strong now). My iPhone has been tanked and off for about 9 days. I popped out the SIM card from the rotten phone, popped out the Samsung SIM tray and dropped in the SIM, pushing the tray back flush. Powered the phone on. Without going through every single step, the setup was so easy and seamless. It automatically found my service provider, so I would say this is pretty much as close to plug and play as you can get. So awesome. I am falling hard like Pete for Ariana for this phone... Well...I've been playing with the phone for a few hours now. I cannot put it down. So many things are infinitely better than Apple. I'm going to list a few and stop the review for Day 1. And if you made it this far, peace and love neighbor. Happy phone hunting. You're beautiful🌞🌜⛱🌚🌟 1. Customization: THEMES! I can't stop trying these out. They change the sounds and wallpapers and App icons and probably other cool stuff I don't realize all at once. They are so cool. Text messages look different. And the wallpapers can be animated. Lock screens can be videos. I am admittedly geeking a little. Android systems let you change soooooooo much. And I am a customization freak. Not only can you choose from hundreds of free and paid themes on the Google Play store, but you can choose from so many different fonts as well (and you can choose from tons for free and money the same way). You can set the order of so many things, it's just the coolest. Oh and here is a great one. For the OCD users like me, who hated when you couldn't delete an apple app, you still have those on Android you cannot delete as well. BUT YOU CAN HIDE THEM! 2. The button clicks are addictive. It feels like you are pushing a button when its the bare screen. I have a screen protector on AND and phone case and it's still extremely responsive. 3. The swiping motions aren't that different from Apple. I'm navigating like a pro. I'm sure there are how-to videos I need to watch to learn all of the shortcuts, but I'm doing just fine. Ok. Enough for now. I'm jonesing to play with the phone waaaaaay more. Ask any questions you want. I will answer all I can. I will update this review as I see the need.

B019TWO7DU,Nathan,5,"February 7, 2016",True,Nexus 6P: Android as it was meant to be,"As an iPhone convert, I was a little skeptical about making the move to Nexus and Android as a whole. I thought the transfer of my data would be hard (it wasn't), and I had a bunch of misconceptions about Android that were ultimately way wrong. I've made the switch and I don't think I'm ever going back. What Google has made is not only the iPhone's cheaper competitor, but also the Android OS as it was made to be; in it's purest form. I've always associated the Android OS with bloatware from carriers, resulting in a not so minimal and often ugly-looking phone. I've also never experienced Android on a premium device, meaning that it left a bad taste in my mouth when I used the OS on some cheap devices. But with Nexus, you get the real Android experience. Everything is buttery smooth, fast, fluid, intuitive, and most importantly, customizable. From the ground up, you can make your phone the way you want it to be. It's up to you how you want your phone to work. Anyways, enough about the OS. Let's talk about the phone itself and what makes it great. 1. Price & Value I buy my electronics for the long haul. The 6P is built superbly and has Gorilla Glass protecting its front and back. Despite what other say, I also find it easy to hold and don't worry about losing my grip on it. The 6P is sturdy, sleek, and unique all at the same time. I also want a good deal too. The 6P delivers on both of those fronts. It's main competitor, the iPhone 6s Plus, is $649 unlocked, and that's for a 16GB model. My 32GB 6P cost around ~$400 after some discounts at Best Buy. There's no doubt in my mind that the 6P is one of the best deals on the market right now. 2. Fingerprint Scanner The placement of the fingerprint scanner (top of the back) is perfect. It's just real natural to place your finger there to unlock your phone, nothing awkward about it. You can also log multiple fingerprints too, meaning that you could pick up the phone with either hand and unlock it. If you prefer not having to enter a password, your prints can be used to buy apps from the Play Store and open certain apps. The scanner is also one of the fastest, if not the fastest out there. The scanner is also incredibly accurate as well. In the few days I've used it, I can count on my hand the number of times it's incorrectly read my print, and that's probably user error. Simply put, Google is killing it here. 3. Camera Talk about a nice camera. I'll let the pictures I took do the talking. While Google's camera app leaves a little to be desired at times, it gets the job done. The camera performs great in all kinds of lighting, and is adept at adjusting to its surroundings. 12 MP is as good as it gets right now in smartphones, and while it's not DSLR-quality, your Instagram feed will still look good. Speaking of DSLR, I took some photos with my Nikon D40 for comparison. The first two are Nexus. *the photos below were untouched.* 4. Design/Size First of all, this phone isn't big at all. No, you don't need to be Lana from Archer to use this phone. I upgraded from a meager iPhone 4s, and was quite concerned about this phone's seemingly gargantuan size. But once you get it in hand, you'll see that you were worried about nothing. It's hard to explain, but you'll never want to have a small phone again after your first day with the 6P. It just feels right. Once you learn how to cradle the phone the right way, you'll forget about the phone's size. If you're still worried about the size, check out this site to compare the 6P to your current phone. http://www.phonearena.com/phones/size I will concede that on some apps, it's mildly inconvenient to stretch your finger all the way across the screen, but this is a small tradeoff for the big beautiful screen that you get. I gushed about the design a bit earlier, but it really is the cat's balls. The front-facing speaker is loud and clear, and won't muffle unless you put your phone face down. On the top, the earpiece produces great call quality and makes it easy to hear your caller. The phone is easy to hold, and the power/volume buttons don't get in the way. The aluminum and metal build make the phone feel and look premium, and it seems as if Google didn't cut any corners in designing this unit. 5. Battery Life A lot of critics have been gushing about this, and rightfully so. Without adjusting any of my settings, or using any battery management apps, the 6P can easily make it through a day and then some of heavy use. This varies of course, but I'm content as long as my phone makes it though the day without needing a charge. If you mess with your settings and/or use apps, the 6P can easily last you a couple of days if you manage the battery effectively. You can also easily analyze which apps are effecting battery performance. Using Google's official cable/adaptor, it takes about a little more than an hour for my phone to go from zero to one-hundred. That's from zero to one-hundred real quick. While the whole USB-C setup isn't exactly ubiquitous yet, it's fast and great for data transfer. The USB-C is reversible and can also be used to reverse charge, meaning that your 6P could charge someone else's USB-C device. 6. Software/Hardware As I said before, Android is what you make of it. Marshmallow is a great OS, and that's amplified by the fact that Google gives you no bloatware or add-ons. I believe that out of the box, only around 3 GB of the 32 total GB is occupied. It's the purest form of Android, how it was meant to be. Everything flows great. Google Now and it's cards are also really convenient once it gets to learn about you. The animations are smooth, glitchless, and the phone is fast thanks to 3GB of RAM. Nexus users also get Android updates first before the general populace, meaning your phone is up-to-date. You can expect these Nexus-only benefits to grow in the future as Google makes it like their iPhone. The Nexus is also equipped with real good hardware. The Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM, and Adreno 430 GPU all work in harmony to keep your experience with games, apps, and multitasking lag-free. The Samsung AMOLED 1440 display is also one of the best screens on the market right now. Heck, the pictures I took looked way better on my Nexus before I uploaded them on my laptop. Colors are bright and vibrant, and video is top-class. The brightness also has a wide range. At its lowest, the screen is even a little too dark for nighttime use. At it's brightest, it can contend with the bright sun. 7. Cellular Data I've been using Google's Project Fi thus far, and I'm really impressed. I got my SIM card in the mail and a nice phone stand LEGO set from them in the mail free of charge. Porting my number over took about five minutes, and my service has been great. Fi uses T-Mobile and Sprint for data, and places calls over Wi-Fi when possible by using encryption/VPN. Using my phone out and about almost seemed faster than my in-home Internet, and calls over both Wi-Fi and cell were clear and great quality. You can also manage your data in the Settings by alerting you when your data used reaches a certain amount, and you can even set a limit that will turn off your phone's data when exceeded. 8. Misses While the Nexus 6P is great by almost every standard in the book, here are a few things I wish this phone would have. - wireless charging - dual SIM port - expandable micro SD - removable battery - different screenshot option (Pressing power/volume down at the same time is awkward. Thankfully you can long press the home button and press the share button on the left to bypass this.) Overall, the Nexus 6P is probably the best value on the phone market. You've got top-of-the-line performance at a significant discount from its main competitor in the Apple 6s Plus, and you get Android in its greatest form. With a great camera, display, hardware, software, and preferred treatment from Google, the Nexus 6P should be in your pocket.

It's the purest form of Android, how it was meant to be. Everything flows great. Google Now and it's cards are also really convenient once it gets to learn about you. The animations are smooth, glitchless, and the phone is fast thanks to 3GB of RAM. Nexus users also get Android updates first before the general populace, meaning your phone is up-to-date. You can expect these Nexus-only benefits to grow in the future as Google makes it like their iPhone. The Nexus is also equipped with real good hardware. The Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM, and Adreno 430 GPU all work in harmony to keep your experience with games, apps, and multitasking lag-free. The Samsung AMOLED 1440 display is also one of the best screens on the market right now. Heck, the pictures I took looked way better on my Nexus before I uploaded them on my laptop. Colors are bright and vibrant, and video is top-class. The brightness also has a wide range. At its lowest, the screen is even a little too dark for nighttime use. At it's brightest, it can contend with the bright sun. 7. Cellular Data I've been using Google's Project Fi thus far, and I'm really impressed. I got my SIM card in the mail and a nice phone stand LEGO set from them in the mail free of charge. Porting my number over took about five minutes, and my service has been great. Fi uses T-Mobile and Sprint for data, and places calls over Wi-Fi when possible by using encryption/VPN. Using my phone out and about almost seemed faster than my in-home Internet, and calls over both Wi-Fi and cell were clear and great quality. You can also manage your data in the Settings by alerting you when your data used reaches a certain amount, and you can even set a limit that will turn off your phone's data when exceeded. 8. Misses While the Nexus 6P is great by almost every standard in the book, here are a few things I wish this phone would have. - wireless charging - dual SIM port - expandable micro SD - removable battery - different screenshot option (Pressing power/volume down at the same time is awkward. Thankfully you can long press the home button and press the share button on the left to bypass this.) Overall, the Nexus 6P is probably the best value on the phone market. You've got top-of-the-line performance at a significant discount from its main competitor in the Apple 6s Plus, and you get Android in its greatest form. With a great camera, display, hardware, software, and preferred treatment from Google, the Nexus 6P should be in your pocket.

This is my experience with Samsung Galaxy S6 When I received the phone it looked like it was new and factory sealed,however I notices residue from an old sticker on the bottom,which was my 1st clue that the phone was not new. However plugged it in for charging in the morning and left it.It took the phone more than 4.5 hours of charging to go to 74% battery, than I had to go to work so I unplugged it (I don't like to leave plugged items when I am not in the house) and left it on the table. Came back approximately 7.5-8 hours later.Without being used but at all, just by sitting on my table for a few hours battery was already at 30%,So I am thinking this cannot be right! Asked a friend who is more knowledgeable than me and he said probably your screen is too bright and you have too many apps working which makes the battery die fast.However how can a bright screen be a problem when the phone is not being used at all. Still left it to charge overnight, the next morning I put on my screen protector and took it work. Notices right away I am sending a few messages, updating my phone book,battery is literally dying for minutes in front of my eyes just by using the phone for text messaging. Still thinking this is not normal for completely new phone,but hey all these new ""big screen, lots of apps"" phones are doing that probably. Went to work, within a few hours battery from charging all night went to 12%,I am used of bringing my charger with me as my current phone is very old and it does not last long,so I plugged it in,for the 2nd time before the end of that day,the phone did not even register the charger! I tried it on another phone and the charger worked perfectly! When back home and tried the charger again,just in case, again phone not registering the charger and the charger worked on my olf phone,. That was my :Ok,that's enough! Just sent the phone back a few minutes ago and I am expecting full refund. I read other reviews for this phone with the same problem.But I also have a couple of friends using Galaxy S6 that they purchased from a cell phone service provider and they don't seem to have issues. So I am not sure if this particular model has these issues or the 3rd party sellers on Amazon are selling old and refurbished phones for new ones! So whichever it is, be on the look out! Phone is not that cheap so these troubles would be normal and not frustrating!

I mostly use it for snake, text messaging, and phone calls. Sometimes I like to take crappy photos with the camera just to show off how un-smart my phone is. I don't need a nice camera on my phone. I have a nice camera and now that I don't have a smart phone I actually carry it with me. I'd attach my blurry nokia photos but I can only send them through bluetooth. Don't get me wrong, I love having the camera in case of emergencies. The texting was a bit to get used to but all of the necessary options are there. I really like that you can switch between text function (T9, #, ect) easily with out going to a menu. My only complaint is that if you have long conversations with a person it sometimes takes a minute for everything to load. I have heard that some people erase messages for more memory but I haven't gotten there yet. The phone calls work pretty well but once again it takes some getting used to the functions. I've had it for over a week now and I finally looked up how to hang up the phone call. (Those big square buttons actually have multiple functions depending on the location that you tap - or look at the illustrations on buttons). Snake is better than ever with the endless mode. I really enjoy that you can switch the controller style. (I prefer the old school up,down,left,right) but there are many other versions that may suit different game play. The phone has a timer, calculator, unit converter, flashlight, and voice recorder (you can make your own ringtones) My students love to give me crap about my ""trap phone"" so I brag any chance I get. Today I told them I only have to charge it every 3 days (unless I'm playing snake) and then I threw it on the ground and told them I didn't have to worry about dropping it. A student asked me how much it was and I said less than $60! I told them that I have internet everywhere I go and I simply do not need a smart phone distracting me from my everyday life while in public and also I don't want to get hooked in the cycle of spending over $500 for a cell phone. I think I'm teaching them about the finer things in life. Edit: I dropped it again to show off its durability and when it hit the ground one of the tabs on the outer case piece bent in and would not immediately snap back in place.

Love stock Android. I don't usually buy phones at launch, but I caved this year. Don't care about the camera, but if this is important for you, look no further. Like it's predecessors, this phone takes nice photos. Cool design, premium feel, and a modestly updated feature set. Android is still Android after all. The phone does feel good in your hand. Screen is very nice and the 90hz refresh is noticeably smooth. If you've been reading reviews, you've probably read all this elsewhere. I do want to like this phone and am going to give it a chance, but I'm going to be merciless if the device doesn't stand up to reasonable everyday use. What do I mean by this? We bought two phones but I've only opened one of them to evaluate. Set up was easy. Connect your devices and less than 10 min later, everything was transferred. Apps installed, then they updated. Ready for testing. WiFi and Bluetooth connection were fast and solid. One thing I was quite impressed with was the sound. After using earlier pixels with front firing speakers I was a little worried. Nothing to worry about here. Sound quality is very good (full and rich), and the gesture navigation skip forward and back worked for me as well, boom! 4K videos looked good and so did ones shot in 1080p. Face unlock. This was another ""on the fence"" item for me. Cool feature and it works, but now they have it all. Our fingerprints from the last generation of phones can now be linked with our faces. Works perfectly in pitch black darkness. Infrared wins. I still have the same (major) concerns as others. The 2800mah battery is tiny. I am extremely skeptical here, but hope I can be proven wrong. No unlimited original res photo storage. I know Google is in business to make money, but what a chump thing to do. It's right up there with them not including a headphone adapter or headphones this time around. So this is the price you pay or accessories you forego to have the latest tech. I believe this could have been done better or differently. It's a flagship phone, or at least that's what Google is calling it. Congrats Google, you've cut just about every corner you possibly could with this device. What's next. Let's see how the device performs in real day-to-day usage. In the car, in a pocket with Bluetooth and the normal stuff we all do with our devices. The TINY subpar battery had better be good. Otherwise 2 of these phones are coming right back to you. My suggestion, if you didn't jump on the launch deal is WAIT. The phone is nice, but the potential for disappointment is there. Black Friday and Christmas are just around the corner too. ***Update Daily use Call and audio quality is good, using a BT headset also good. Streaming music to the cars audio system working well. Android 10 has a few quirks, but is working and very stable. I haven't had any performance issues with the device or its OS. Although I had WiFi calling on my 3XL (AT&T) , it will not activate on this device. May I have to call them to see why. ***Update after 3 weeks of ownership While I am fully sold on the Face Unlock feature, I still miss the finger print reader. Its just something you become used to after years of pixel ownership. I've only caught myself trying to unlock the phone about 3 times with my finger. I set up face unlock without glasses, but it works when I put on reading glasses, and also while wearing sun glasses (that one is amazing). One thing people and (google) haven't thought of. Currently, Face Unlock works even your eyes are closed. Google has said they are going to release an update that addresses this. Ok, so what happens when I'm wearing sunglasses? Trusted Devices or Places will probably address this. My phone stays unlocked in the car and at home or work. But if you are outside walking around and wearing sun glasses, you might have to PIN into the device or lift your sunglasses. This is still an unknown I guess. I called AT&T and we determined the IMEI of the phone was not ""whitelisted"" on their network. Hence the reason why I couldn't activate Wi-Fi calling. It took them 3 days, but they re-provisioned the SIM (remotely) and added the ID. Wi-Fi Calling works now. If you have this problem with a new phone (any brand) that is compatible with voLTE and Wi-Fi calling, but was not purchased through your carrier (subsidy) there is always a possibility that the phone will not be ""whitelisted"". You have to call customer care and be really nice. I got lucky the first time I called, sometimes it takes more than one call. The second device (other P4) which is also with AT&T (but a different plan) will not allow Wi-Fi to be activated either, so this means another call to the carrier. Hand off between Cellular and Wi-Fi or vice versa works 98% of the time. I've had a few dropped calls say when I'm walking into work or the house and the phone transitions from Cellular to Wi-Fi. Mostly however, it works and is stable. For those who have had Google Fi, you'll know exactly what I am talking about. Wi-Fi calling capable devices attempt to switch aggressively whenever they can move voice calls to Wi-Fi. The new Google Assistant is very good. The AI they have built into the core of the OS is impressive. Not needing a cellular or Wi-Fi connection to use it makes it extremely fast. For me, this is probably the most notable upgrade from a Android/hardware perspective. BIGGEST concern >> the 2800mah battery. Remarkably, the phone lasts all day and well into the next morning without being charged. I had concerns about going to sleep with a low battery and having the phone die during the night and then no alarm in the morning. Well, it hasn't been a problem. I typically have 17-30% percent remaining in the morning and can easily throw the phone on charge before leaving the house. I have the ""always on"" display turned on, and allow all notifications to display on my lock screen. I have gesture navigation enabled which keeps the soli radar chip active and looking for gestures above the device when its stationary. I stream videos and play music over Bluetooth in the car. I also use navigation when walking frequently. Normal use and the battery has held up well. This is really a matter of personal preference and your usage. Initial reviews said 3-4 hrs of screen time should be expected. I'm getting 5-6hrs. If you are on your phone for hours a day, or play games, get the XL. In closing, I have found myself >>inconvenienced<< more than once since the phone did not come with a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I have headphones, but have been left to work one handed because I don't have my BT headset with me. Google > BIGGEST CHUMP MOVE EVER. Really pissed me off. I've ordered one. Tired of the inconvenience. With that said, my original recommendation stands. If you cannot buy the P4 or XL at a serious discount, WAIT. It is not worth the full retail price, regardless of the new ""features"". Its over priced for what you get, and Google has cut way too many corners seriously detracting from the value you receive vs. cost of the device at full price. Still 64GB of storage, small 2800mah battery, no adapters, no headphones, no unlimited full res photo storage.. Other people have said this too. Google has had several chances to build and release good devices. They just can't get it right. You pay for a flagship and there is always a compromise. In the case of the P4, its one after another. ***Final Update 6 weeks of ownership. I am enjoying the phone and it's working as I intended. I had Android 10 on my 3XL so no surprises there. As usual Google continues to improve and refine it's OS. Everything just works. This is why I buy Pixels. While I like the phone, this years Pixels did not wow me like those of previous years. It's a phone, it's running the latest version of Android but that's about it. The new AI built into the Google Assistant remains the most noteable ""feature"" from an upgrade perspective for me. But like before, that's it. The premium price tag is just disproportional to the value you are receiving. I am a fan of Android, but this year Apple and OnePlus nailed it from a hardware perspective. Cost to value ratio. They came through where you (Google) failed. The P4 isn't even 2 months old and most carriers are practically giving them away. Not to mention Google has substantially increased trade in values for older devices to entice new buyers. Which leads me to ask.. Google are you giving up on Pixel? Does this mean Samsung and OnePlus devices for everyone next year. Man you guys got some black eyes this year. All avoidable too. I can say this. Nice phone, but I won't buy your device at launch next year. Everyone, I urge you to heed these words. Do not pay full price for this device.

B07V5KS95Y,Wayne,5,"August 25, 2019",False,One of the few phones worth it's crazy price,"SMARTPHONE INTRO I've been buying the latest and greats smartphones since the early HTC days and have owned just about every significant Samsung smartphone release since then. Every year I will stray over to other manufacturers to see what the big and small players are up to. Most, but not all of the time, I find myself right back to my Samsung phone as the daily driver. Which is usually a Note. Now that Samsung has released another Note series for an increasingly high price, let's see how it does. In particular against my Note 9 that it's replacing. PROS: + Excellent build quality + The high-resolution OLED display somehow looks even better than before + Superfast performance; zero lag + Much improved speakers that you can *feel* + The bezels continue to disappear; nearly all-screen + Core functions, such as phone calls, still work great + Lots of internal storage + expandable storage + Generous battery that truely lasts all-day + Fast wired and wireless charging for those very heavy phone usage days + The ever-useful stylus continues to evolve + 3 Camera Lenses for any scenario + Great picture & video quality with some useful features CONS: - Hole punch camera is distracting - The in-screen fingerprint reader takes a few steps back from the physical sensor - RIP headphone jack - Price keeps going up DESIGN Compared to the Galaxy Note 9, the Galaxy Note 10+ feels much more substantial than I expected. It has more heft and somehow even more solid feel to it. In particular with the Samsung OEM cases. Which are also expensive, but continue the high-quality impression of what you are holding in the hand. The left side has the volume up/down and power button. The bottom is USB-C port and stylus holder. The rest of the phone is fairly clean and simple. I prefer power on the right, but it's easy enough to get used to after a few hours. I opted for the white version to mix things up and I like it. It still provides a nice high-end look all while resisting visible fingerprints (and probably scratches) than most darker and shinier colors. Even with a 6.8"" display, it's still roughly the same size as the Note 9. There is now simply less bezel. But due to the squared corners, it never feels small. If you aren't already used to large phones, this will take some getting used to. And as manufacturers continue to slowly push the size of phones combined with no more bezels to shrink, this is probably about as large as I expect a mainstream phone to go. Any further and folks are going to have issues. SOFTWARE Long ago this used to be Samsung's weakest point. They'd throw lots of half-baked features with no optimization, resulting in lots of lag and bloat. Those days are long gone. Samsung nailed that down with the Galaxy S9/Note 9 series. Except with the Note 10, it's even faster, and smoother. Which I suspect much credit goes toward the Snapdragon 855. I should note that I am a fan of Google's Android Experience. But every time I jump over to a Google phone (or another brand), I immediately start to miss all of the small but very useful features Samsung has built into their phone. The game launcher, scene optimizer, multiple lenses, display quality, high-end specs, etc. And honestly, after easily disabling Bixby, there isn't that much bloat. Disable/Remove a few random apps like Facebook and I'm good to go. PERFORMANCE As noted above, the performance is absolutely fantastic. Usually while going through initial setup or installing apps, these phones tend to get very laggy. This was probably the only time I saw a hint of lag, but surprisingly minimal. In that, I could easily and quickly perform other tasks while downloading and installing apps, games, music, etc. Each year as performance increases, the need for synthetic benchmarks decrease. I think they still serve a purpose in limited use-cases for a ""reliable"" baseline. But today, I'm not going to bother. This phone is fast and can do everything you want. DISPLAY & AUDIO The 6.8"" WQHD+ Dynamic AMOLED display combined with some significantly improved speakers are simply the best upgrades from previous phones. Watching high-resolution content on YouTube or Netflix look and sound fantastic. I found myself glued to the screen during my demo session with various clips. Even the icons on the desktop almost pop from the screen. As though they are right there touching your fingers. The speakers finally have some force behind them as well. Allowing you to ""feel"" the vibrations in your hand. And yes, they are quite loud. With Atmos-enabled they provide a great stereo separation effect. I'll also mention there is an included screen protected. It's very thin but it's quite unobtrusive. I usually remove these. But since it virtually covers the entire screen and provides a smooth swiping experience, I'll leave it for now. And last I'll briefly mention the hole punch as it does have a negative impact with the multimedia experience. Anytime there is a bright scene around that area, my eyes are immediately drawn to it. This needs go away sooner rather than later. CAMERAS As the camera count increases, so too does the usefulness, functionality, and flexibility. The rear now has a 16MB ultra-wide camera, 12MP wide-angle camera (normal), and 12MP telephoto camera. The introduction of wide-angle is super useful and one I use very often. Each camera captures excellent pictures. I told my Pixel 3 and don't have it for comparison today. Are there better cameras available? I'm sure there are. But unless you are really comparing back-to-back, I doubt you'd notice. In particular, if you like to record video. That's one area the Pixel and some other phones don't do as well. The stability and clarity when recording 4K @ 60fp is excellent. Combined with solid audio recording and you've got a great overall camera package. I'm not into selfies, but that 10MP camera is somewhat mandatory these days. It's unfortunate it has resulted in a small but very noticeable hole in the screen. Which as noted above, is absolutely noticeable. In either case, it takes solid pictures as well. No complaints there. FINGERPRINT READER Unfortunately, there is another negative feature change. With the Galaxy Note 9, and virtually every other phone with a physical reader, you can just rest your finger and quickly unlock/wake your phone. With Samsung's implementation of the in-screen reader, you have to press firmly and wait a second for it to register. And if it doesn't read your fingerprint right away, it may be a few seconds or repeated attempts. If the screen is turned on, it does tend to be quicker. But you still need to press firmly and wait longer than in the past. I'm really hoping a software update improves this. Otherwise, I may just go back to the power button and a pin. DEX & ""YOUR PHONE"" There are a lot of other software features, but I did want to highlight these two as they are unique and stand out for me. I got used to Dex with my last Samsung phone. And there continue to be minor but useful improvements. Dex is surprisingly useful if you want to do some light work. When I'm on-the-go I can easily plug in a USB-C to HDMI cable, Bluetooth keyboard/mouse and have a portable desktop experience. You can also now use a normal USB cable and windows app to access Dex, it's just not ideal for games and multimedia. I've got personal and work e-mail, browser, youtube, office apps, and a range of other tools. I don't need to do video or photo editing on the go. And I found this can meet just about any task I need or want to do while traveling. This is a little more useful on a tablet, but in a different way, as the keyboard is already included. Less to travel with. And then there is the new Your Phone feature. This is a little more ""early stage"" in development, but still handy. Just plug in a USB cable to any Windows PC and you can mirror what's on your phone. You also have direct access to messages, but the mirror function is nice. You can interact with your phone, on the PC. All while charging it. I'd like to see more dedicated ports into this app. But being able to see and respond to any notification is great. Just don't expect to play games or smoothly stream youtube. THE PHONE That's right, this is still a phone. And as such, it needs to make phone calls! And other core functions. As I use this for both personal and work, this is a critical but often overlooked feature. While it may feel like more of a check-box item, I've had more than a few phones over the years that still fail in this arena. I'm pleased to report that phone calls and text are excellent. Speakerphone works well. No issues with hearing anybody and vice versa. The radios appear to be good quality. Bluetooth is reliable as well as wi-fi, which is very fast. I'm easily pushing 300-400Mbps up/down with my Google Mesh Wireless network. CONCLUSION So how exactly do you justify a $1,100 phone? Honestly, you really don't justify it. At least not in the traditional sense. My Note 9 would have continued to serve me well for another year. But we buy these phones because they're interesting, they entertain us, and they make life a little bit easier. And considering the significant percentage of time many of us spend on these portable gadgets, it starts to make sense that we want to allocate more budget towards them. While it's not perfect (no phone is), I still believe Samsung has enough features, functionality, quality, and performance for me to ""justify"" the Galaxy Note 10+'s price and keep it as my daily driver for another year. I'll still grab a few more phones that intrigue me between now and the Note 11, but I'd be surprised if they truly replaced this one.

B07536MYBQ,E Hall,5,"September 15, 2017",False,Phone junkie loves the Note 8,"I have had 30+ smart phones over the past 9 years from HTC, Motorola, Nexus (all except the 4), Blackberry Key One and all of the Galaxy S models plus the Note 2, 4, 5 and now the 8. My favorite phone was the Note 5, but one day I walked into T-Mobile prepared to buy the Note 7 and something steered me away from it. I ended up walking out with an S7 which was a foolish purchase because I only used it for a couple of weeks before I started missing my Note 5. Fortunately I still had it so I put my SIM back in it and all was well. When news of the Note 8 broke I was thrilled and I couldn't wait for pre-orders to start so when they did, I ordered one and it arrived one week ago today. My favorite thing over the Note 5 is the beautiful edge to edge display and how bright and legible it is in direct sunlight. At 1,200 nits, I believe it is the brightest screen ever on any smartphone even eclipsing my Blackberry Classic that I thought would never be beat. I am amazed that reviewers never mention screen brightness, but for me it is a very important top 3 feature because I spend quite a bit of time outdoors and it is very annoying searching for shade or trying to cup my hand over the screen just to barely read it. I can assure you that you will not be disappointed at all with anything regarding the Note 8 screen. I have taken approximately 100 pictures and the cameras are excellent. My daughter and I just went out for Chinese food and we were taking pictures of the food and several of my Heineken bottle. She was using her IPhone 7 plus and her pictures were no match for the Note 8 when our phones were held side by side. Her photos looked washed out and dull compared to mine and she even admitted her 7 plus paled in comparison. I like to take macro shots of flowers, insects and lots of other things and all I can say is woww. One shot was of a ladybug and the closeup detail was amazing. The S Pen is more refined and I use it frequently. The single speaker is very loud and clear as is the call quality. Build quality is excellent, but I still despise glass on the back of a phone. People can go on and on about how beautiful the back is, but the same people immediately slap a case on it so its never seen anyway. Why not use some sort of a rubber or polycarbonate back and make it lighter, cheaper, grippier and definitely more durable. After all, this is a mobile device and some people actually use it outdoors and don't like cases. Probably my biggest gripe is the additional weight compared to the Note 5. At 195 grams the additional weight is definitely noticeable and like most men, I carry it in my pocket and there's never a doubt where my phone is. Samsung was smart enough to keep the headphone jack and I assume the SD card is here to stay. I have played with Bixby briefly, but don't know enough about it to comment on how useful it is. I had two ultra thin cases ready and waiting and the one I like best is the matte blue Bear Motion case. It's very thin and light and adds a ton of grip to this rediculously slippery device. It is very fluid and lightning fast and at this point I can see myself using only this phone for at least one year.

My favorite phone was the Note 5, but one day I walked into T-Mobile prepared to buy the Note 7 and something steered me away from it. I ended up walking out with an S7 which was a foolish purchase because I only used it for a couple of weeks before I started missing my Note 5. Fortunately I still had it so I put my SIM back in it and all was well. When news of the Note 8 broke I was thrilled and I couldn't wait for pre-orders to start so when they did, I ordered one and it arrived one week ago today. My favorite thing over the Note 5 is the beautiful edge to edge display and how bright and legible it is in direct sunlight. At 1,200 nits, I believe it is the brightest screen ever on any smartphone even eclipsing my Blackberry Classic that I thought would never be beat. I am amazed that reviewers never mention screen brightness, but for me it is a very important top 3 feature because I spend quite a bit of time outdoors and it is very annoying searching for shade or trying to cup my hand over the screen just to barely read it. I can assure you that you will not be disappointed at all with anything regarding the Note 8 screen. I have taken approximately 100 pictures and the cameras are excellent. My daughter and I just went out for Chinese food and we were taking pictures of the food and several of my Heineken bottle. She was using her IPhone 7 plus and her pictures were no match for the Note 8 when our phones were held side by side. Her photos looked washed out and dull compared to mine and she even admitted her 7 plus paled in comparison. I like to take macro shots of flowers, insects and lots of other things and all I can say is woww. One shot was of a ladybug and the closeup detail was amazing.

B018OMP8ES,TW B.,4,"October 1, 2016",True,Great phone - 95% satisfied. (I wish it had external SD),"Unfortunately this review comes a little late in the game, and likely wouldn't have even happened had I not smashed my Galaxy S5. - Quick Background - I am in the tech industry by trade, and have been an android user since the Motorola Droid first arrived. My recording studio is exclusively Apple Products, though only out of necessity due to the software tools I create music with. (...and though I don't look down on the iPhone community, I personally would never choose to own one.) - I don't jump on the finance and upgrade bandwagon, so I haven't used the S6, S7, or S7 Note/PocketBomb.

B07N11SM58,Achint,4,"March 17, 2019",True,I love this phone but you might not,"Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  I feel that this phone is going to get a lot of polarized opinions as this phone packs some punch in the camera department but it might not be what people will expect. The main highlight of this phone is its 5 cameras and this might sound better than other flagship phones which have 2 or 3 cameras, but this phone's cameras are used in an entirely different way than the other phones (more on that later.) While most of the other phones process the picture after taking the picture e.g. they will enhance the contrast or details, this phone does not process the image in a similar way. The traditional image processing is kept at a minimum because that control is given to the user. I have found that with my earlier phone colors in the pictures were way more saturated than in real life. This has been a gripe for some of the photographers who use the phone to take a picture and find that the phone image processing has cranked the image attributes too high for their liking, so they prefer to shoot in RAW which lets them be in control. This phone seems to be aimed at doing that and gives control to the user to decide how they want their picture to look like. This might sound a good idea but most of the people don't want that much finer control and are fine with what their phone cranks out. So while comparing stock pictures of a brightly lit scene from this phone and other phones, you might find this phone takes dull pictures while others have eye-popping colors and might end up in thinking that camera on this phone is not good. This phone is a photographer's phone who loves to tinker and play around with their images. If you think you are that kind of person then this phone is for you. Of course, the camera on this phone has several other huge advantages over other phones as well (and not just the picture processing controls) which I have covered below. But let's start with the basic specification of this phone OS: Android 9.0 a.k.a. Android Pie (certified under Android One program) Chipset: Snapdragon 845 GPU: Adreno 630 RAM: 6GB Storage: 128 GB Rear cameras: 5 cameras with each camera being 12 MP, f/1.8, 28mm. Of the 5 cameras, 2 are RGB camera, 3 are B/W cameras, and one TOF (Time of flight sensor.) More on cameras below. Front camera: 20 MP. Video recording: Rear camera is capable of recording at 2160p@30fps (4K), 1080p@30fps (Full HD). You can also record videos in 4K UHD. Screen Size: 5.99 inches Screen resolution: 1440 x 2880 pixels with 538 PPI. Screen type: POLED (Plastic AMOLED, more on that later) Screen protection: Gorilla glass 5. Authentication technologies: in-display fingerprint reader, Face Unlock Charging: Quick Charge 3.0 (Fast battery charging 18W), Qi (Fast Wireless charging 10W) Battery: 3320mAh. For me, it lasts more than a day. I don't watch many videos on this phone and my calls on the phone is limited to 15-20 minutes a day. Other features: HDR support NFC support IP67 water resistance rating (can be submerged in up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes) USB-C port MY IMPRESSIONS OF THIS PHONE BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE 1. For a phone that is marketed as a photographer's phone, the phone's camera app needs considerable work. Launching the app, changing the app mode (e.g. between slow motion, video, bokeh mode) is terribly slow. The camera app glitches out often by giving error ""Unable to connect of the camera"". I missed a couple of opportunities to take a picture because the camera app took too long to open. I am hoping the camera app would get updated to fix these issues. Patience is going to be the key while dealing with the camera app on this phone. 2. The fingerprint sensor is very glitchy. It doesn't work more than half of the time and keeps prompting to press the glass harder. This is an inherent problem with these optical-based fingerprint sensors, instead of newer phones that come with ultrasonic based fingerprint sensors that are more accurate. The in-screen sensor is also slower than the capacitive based optical sensors found on other phones e.g. iPhones, and Pixel phones. However, the face unlock feature of this phone really great and I rarely have to use the fingerprint unlock most of the times, but when the fingerprint authentication is used for authentication in apps, it can be really annoying that you might have to try 5-10 times for the app to recognize the fingerprint. HMD has said that there will be a software update to address this but I doubt that even that will make much difference. I would highly recommend enabling the face-unlock feature as it works quite beautifully. 3. The automatic brightness adjustment seems to be little sluggish. On my Lumia 950XL, I could see the brightness change between different lighting conditions, but the automatic brightness control on this phone doesn't seem to be that sensitive. The display is beautiful and I can read clearly in sunlight. But sometimes when I am in direct sunlight the phone doesn't adjust the brightness or it takes noticeably longer to adjust the screen brightness. 4. You can take the pictures quickly with this camera but it processes all the information of the picture in the background and that can take a significant amount of time (between 5-10 seconds.) You can continue to take pictures while processing of pictures is going on, but if you want to go back and take a look at the picture immediately, then you would have to wait. 5. The build of this phone is good but is in no way a head turner. The top and bottom bezels clearly scream of a mid-range smartphone. But then given the price of this phone, a bezel-less design for the screen might be too much to ask for. GOOD THINGS 1. The Android updates are fast. This phone got the March update in March, and the only other phones that have this update is Pixel and Essential phones. 2. The face-unlock feature works well. Most of the time it would unlock the phone before I could even reach for the fingerprint authentication. Though it doesn't seem to work in dark or low light conditions, which would need an IR scanner. 3. I love all the tweaking and picture controls on the phone. If you are shooting in bokeh mode then one more option ""Color pop"" shows up for the photo which mutes the color around the subject you want to focus on bringing out the colors of the subject. 4. Even though this phone does not have a dedicated camera button, you can still press the power/lock button two times to launch the camera app (this works even if the phone is locked.) Once in the camera app, you can press the volume button (either volume up or down) to take a picture. THINGS YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE 1. This phone produces what is being called as ""Natural looking pictures"". You would want to tweak the pictures with the editing tools provided in this phone to get better-looking pictures. I love playing around with the color contrast, light, depth settings, but if you are taking dozens of pictures of a trip then it might not be possible to tweak each picture manually. 2. This phone has 5 cameras which do provide a different and better picture. However, for video only one camera (RB one) is used. This is mainly because handling video information from 5 different cameras would have been overwhelming for the phone's hardware. 3. There is no headphone jack. This is the biggest thing I miss in this phone. Although there is a USB C to headphone jack adapter provided, I still feel that it wouldn't compensate for a missing headphone jack. 4. Last year's chipset i.e. Snapdragon 845. This may not be a huge deal (more on this topic below) 5. No external sd card expansion slot. A common missing feature these days. 6. No OIS (but it has EIS, what's the difference? more on this topic below) 7. No video recording at 60 fps. 8. Non-removable battery (again a standard missing feature with the most phone these days) 9. No color options, just midnight blue ... but if you are using a case on it then it won't be an issue. 10. No IR blaster 11. No Radio WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH 5 CAMERAS This phone utilizes its 5 cameras differently. Most of the phones have multiple cameras of different focal lengths. For instance, Samsung Galaxy S10 has 3 cameras: regular camera, ultrawide angle camera, and telephoto (zoom) camera. If the user tries to zoom in while taking a picture the telephoto lens will kick in, zooming out utilizes the ultrawide camera. So only one camera is being utilized depending upon how much the user wants to zoom into the scene. This is a way for the phone to provide zoom functionality with the lens/camera a.k.a. optical zoom instead of simulating it in software a.k.a. digital zoom. Nokia PureView's 5 camera system works in a very different way. All 5 cameras take a picture at the same time but they collect different type of information about the scene. When a picture is taken the 2 RGB cameras and 3 monochrome cameras take a picture at the same time and collect more information about the scene. RGB cameras usually capture color information about the scene by selectively blocking out light (e.g. the Red pixel on the sensor of RGB camera would block out everything but Red light to determine how much red light is being generated at a particular spot in the scene.) Monochrome (or Black and White) cameras do not block light selectively and thus capture the intensity of light. So they can capture more detail. Nokia Pureview's camera then combines all the information from 5 cameras into one picture and produces a single picture. This process is called image stacking as we are piling up the information of all images on top of each other. Image stacking is not new in smartphone cameras. The Pixel phones use image stacking in one of their features called Night Sight which provides better pictures in low light. Pixel's camera takes 15 photos with different exposure level and stacks them together. But since Pixel has a single camera it has to take the photos one after the other and then compensate for movement of the object or the camera in software. However, since PureView's has multiple cameras so it takes a picture at the same time and image stacking should be relatively better in these. Also, because of the monochrome cameras, you can take Black and White photos natively in camera instead of taking colored pictures and then converting them to black and white. The only advantage of using a monochrome camera is that it is able to capture much more detail than converting a colored picture to black and white. Also, you can shoot in depth mode or bokeh mode (as mentioned in the camera app of this phone) to produce a bokeh effect. Bokeh effect is basically having one object sharp and in focus while the background is blurred. This is quite handy for taking portrait pictures of an object, person, or food which is usually in focus while the background is blurred. You can take a picture in depth mode which will make Pureview's camera can depth information of the scene. This phone has ToF (Time of flight) sensor which can determine the depth of the objects in the scene and can take collect depth information for 1200 layers. More depth means a more gradual and more realistic blurring of the background. Pixel phone, for example, contains only two layers of information which are the subject and the background. The background is blurred equally in Pixel's phone while with PureView's camera you can have a gradual blur effect since it captures so much information about the scene. After the picture is taken, you can then move the focus point to wherever you like and background will be blurred to your liking. If you shoot a picture in bokeh mode then you can apply ""Color pop"" filter to the picture as well which mutes the color of objects surrounding the focused object. You can also install Adobe Lightroom during the setup process and HMD has worked with Adobe to provide a custom profile for the Pureview's lens. WHAT IS THE TALK OF THIS PHONE BEING LAST GEN The latest trend of mobile phones in 2018 and 2019 is the bezel-less design with edge to edge screens. PureView 9 has bezels on the top and bottom of the screen. These are not too distracting and I personally am comfortable with this. The problem with an edge to edge screens is that the screen needs to accommodate the front-facing cameras and the slot of the earpiece, so manufacturers have to resort to solutions like notches and punch hole designs in the screen. This phone also has Snapdragon 845 chipset which is considered to be a 2018 year model while all the latest phones coming up with Snapdragon 855. The Snapdragon chipset has a limitation of only being able to use only 2 cameras at the same time, so HMD was working with Light company to interface their processor called Lux-Capacitor with Snapdragon chipset. This took effort and time on their part and this phone was delayed. The result is this phone is released in early 2019 with an older chipset. The main differences between Snapdragon 845 and 855 are: 1. Snapdragon 855 offers better performance (graphics performance, app launch etc) 2. Snapdragon 855 has better support for AI assistants (e.g. Alexa, Cortana, Google voice assistants) 3. Snapdragon 855 supports 5G (sort-of) For me, these differences were not significant enough to make a difference, but if you use a lot of graphics intensive applications or games then you might get better performance from a phone that has Snapdragon 855 chipset e.g. Samsung Galaxy S10, OnePlus 5G. Other than the chipset being old the in display fingerprint reader is optical instead of ultrasonic as the one used in Samsung Galaxy S10. Optical fingerprint readers are slower and less accurate. This is another issue with this phone that the finger scanner is borderline useless sometimes. Also, this phone uses Gorilla glass 5 instead of Gorilla glass 6 which is used in Samsung Galaxy S10. But all in all, I felt the price difference between this phone and the other ""better"" flagship phones justified the configuration of this phone. WHAT IS ANDROID ONE Android One is a program by Google under which phones manufacturers install a non-modified version of Andoird operating system on the phone. Several of the manufacturers install their own UI over Android e.g. Samsung phones install OneUI on their phones, while Huaweiâ€™s phone has EMUI OS. In addition to that some manufacturer's install their own apps e.g. Samsung phones come pre-installed with apps such as Bixby, Galaxy Store, Samsung+ some of which may not even be removed. Some of these modifications bring refreshing changes e.g. Samsun's OneUI provides a system-wide dark theme, ability to change system fonts which Android lacks natively. But some people find these apps to be annoying and slowing down their system, and these customizations are often referred to as bloatware. Another effect of these manufacturer's customizations is that when a new version of OS is released, manufacturers have to test their apps and their UI before releasing the update to their phones. This usually updates to these phones get delayed from weeks to months. Under the Android One program, manufacturer's agree that there would be no customizations on their part. This means that the phones certified under Android One program get faster updates. Also, phones under Android One programs are guaranteed to receive OS update for 2 years and security updates for 3 years. Android One phone also manages background apps so that battery drain is kept to a minimum. Android Pie is the version of the Android operating system that is installed on this phone under the Android One program. DOES IT MATTER IF THIS PHONE DOESN'T HAVE OIS This phone doesn't have the OIS (optical image stabilization) which is present in most of the flagships phones these days. Instead, this phone contains Electronic Image stabilization (EIS) which is present in medium price range phones. Both of these OIS and EIS provide image stabilization i.e. they correct the sudden movement/shake of the camera hands while taking a picture or video to avoid the blurry or smudge effect. OIS does this by having extra hardware (floating lens element) in front of the camera lens to compensate for the movement of the phone while taking a picture or making a video. You might even see a bump in the camera for the phones that use OIS (but not always the case.) EIS, on the other hand, does the image stabilization entirely in software by applying algorithms to the video by looking at multiple frames of the video or using sensors and gyroscopes in the phone to determine the shake of the camera and adjusting the picture/video accordingly. Since EIS is done entirely in software and uses sensors/hardware that is usually present in the phone so phones with EIS tend to be cheaper to keep the price down. OIS seems to have an upper hand in taking pictures in low light conditions where they allow the lens to be open longer for collecting light. But for photography in general light conditions, EIS and OIS should be on par with each other. I made videos with my Lumia 950 XL (which has OIS) and Pureview 9, and I found the stabilization to be par with each other. WHAT IS pAMOLED pAMOLED, that stands for Plastic Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode, is another type of screen being used today in phones (other being LCD.) OLED is the component of the screen that generates the light and colors in the screen. It comprises of a sheet/sheets that are made of an organic compound (i.e. containing carbon.) OLED screen can be controlled either through a passive or active matrix control scheme. In a passive matrix configuration, power is provided to each row of pixels in the OLED sheet, while in an active matrix configuration each pixel can be powered and controlled individually using a control matrix of transistors. Passive matrix is cheap but requires higher voltage as the size of the pixel row increases i.e. the resolution of screen increases. The various components of the screen such as the transistor control matrix, anode, a cathode are on a base layer (called a substrate.) The substrate layer can be made of plastic or glass. In this case, the substrate is made of plastic. All of the phones that use OLED use Active matrix configuration since Passive matrix configuration becomes difficult to manage for higher resolution screens. The plastic substrate allows for thinner screen panels as the plastic substrate layer is comparatively thinner and flexible than a glass substrate layer making it more suitable for curved screens such as Samsung galaxy edge phones. OLED screens provide more contrasts and deeper blacks than LCD (since in OLED individual pixel can be turned off) and are catching up with LCD screens in popularity as their cost becomes less. Samsung, LG, BOE seem to be the biggest manufacturers of OLED screens right now. IS THIS PHONE BY NOKIA OR HMD GLOBAL Nokia had sold its mobile division to Microsoft. Under this deal, Nokia could not return to Mobile business until 2015. Once 2015 arrived and Nokia could enter the mobile business again, instead of creating their own mobile phones again Nokia licensed their brand name to HMD global company. HMD global also acquired the licensing rights for the PureView brand in August 2018. Even though HMD global is not the same company as Nokia many of the key people in HMD global are former employees of Nokia e.g. the CEO of HMD global Florian Seiche, COO of HMD global Pia Kantola, CFO of HMD global Anssi RÃ¶nnemaa used to work at Nokia.",280.0,Nokia,"Nokia 9 PureView - Android 9.0 Pie - 128 GB - Single Sim Unlocked Smartphone (at&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/H2O) - 5.99"" QHD+ Screen - Qi Wireless Charging - Midnight Blue - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-PureView-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07N11SM58,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ls1kpJJsL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N11SM58,61,499.99,699.0,"I love this phone but you might not Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  I feel that this phone is going to get a lot of polarized opinions as this phone packs some punch in the camera department but it might not be what people will expect. The main highlight of this phone is its 5 cameras and this might sound better than other flagship phones which have 2 or 3 cameras, but this phone's cameras are used in an entirely different way than the other phones (more on that later.) While most of the other phones process the picture after taking the picture e.g. they will enhance the contrast or details, this phone does not process the image in a similar way. The traditional image processing is kept at a minimum because that control is given to the user. I have found that with my earlier phone colors in the pictures were way more saturated than in real life. This has been a gripe for some of the photographers who use the phone to take a picture and find that the phone image processing has cranked the image attributes too high for their liking, so they prefer to shoot in RAW which lets them be in control. This phone seems to be aimed at doing that and gives control to the user to decide how they want their picture to look like. This might sound a good idea but most of the people don't want that much finer control and are fine with what their phone cranks out. So while comparing stock pictures of a brightly lit scene from this phone and other phones, you might find this phone takes dull pictures while others have eye-popping colors and might end up in thinking that camera on this phone is not good. This phone is a photographer's phone who loves to tinker and play around with their images. If you think you are that kind of person then this phone is for you. Of course, the camera on this phone has several other huge advantages over other phones as well (and not just the picture processing controls) which I have covered below. But let's start with the basic specification of this phone OS: Android 9.0 a.k.a. Android Pie (certified under Android One program) Chipset: Snapdragon 845 GPU: Adreno 630 RAM: 6GB Storage: 128 GB Rear cameras: 5 cameras with each camera being 12 MP, f/1.8, 28mm. Of the 5 cameras, 2 are RGB camera, 3 are B/W cameras, and one TOF (Time of flight sensor.) More on cameras below. Front camera: 20 MP. Video recording: Rear camera is capable of recording at 2160p@30fps (4K), 1080p@30fps (Full HD). You can also record videos in 4K UHD. Screen Size: 5.99 inches Screen resolution: 1440 x 2880 pixels with 538 PPI. Screen type: POLED (Plastic AMOLED, more on that later) Screen protection: Gorilla glass 5. Authentication technologies: in-display fingerprint reader, Face Unlock Charging: Quick Charge 3.0 (Fast battery charging 18W), Qi (Fast Wireless charging 10W) Battery: 3320mAh. For me, it lasts more than a day. I don't watch many videos on this phone and my calls on the phone is limited to 15-20 minutes a day. Other features: HDR support NFC support IP67 water resistance rating (can be submerged in up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes) USB-C port MY IMPRESSIONS OF THIS PHONE BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE 1. For a phone that is marketed as a photographer's phone, the phone's camera app needs considerable work. Launching the app, changing the app mode (e.g. between slow motion, video, bokeh mode) is terribly slow. The camera app glitches out often by giving error ""Unable to connect of the camera"". I missed a couple of opportunities to take a picture because the camera app took too long to open. I am hoping the camera app would get updated to fix these issues. Patience is going to be the key while dealing with the camera app on this phone. 2. The fingerprint sensor is very glitchy. It doesn't work more than half of the time and keeps prompting to press the glass harder. This is an inherent problem with these optical-based fingerprint sensors, instead of newer phones that come with ultrasonic based fingerprint sensors that are more accurate. The in-screen sensor is also slower than the capacitive based optical sensors found on other phones e.g. iPhones, and Pixel phones. However, the face unlock feature of this phone really great and I rarely have to use the fingerprint unlock most of the times, but when the fingerprint authentication is used for authentication in apps, it can be really annoying that you might have to try 5-10 times for the app to recognize the fingerprint. HMD has said that there will be a software update to address this but I doubt that even that will make much difference. I would highly recommend enabling the face-unlock feature as it works quite beautifully. 3. The automatic brightness adjustment seems to be little sluggish. On my Lumia 950XL, I could see the brightness change between different lighting conditions, but the automatic brightness control on this phone doesn't seem to be that sensitive. The display is beautiful and I can read clearly in sunlight. But sometimes when I am in direct sunlight the phone doesn't adjust the brightness or it takes noticeably longer to adjust the screen brightness. 4. You can take the pictures quickly with this camera but it processes all the information of the picture in the background and that can take a significant amount of time (between 5-10 seconds.) You can continue to take pictures while processing of pictures is going on, but if you want to go back and take a look at the picture immediately, then you would have to wait. 5. The build of this phone is good but is in no way a head turner. The top and bottom bezels clearly scream of a mid-range smartphone. But then given the price of this phone, a bezel-less design for the screen might be too much to ask for. GOOD THINGS 1. The Android updates are fast. This phone got the March update in March, and the only other phones that have this update is Pixel and Essential phones. 2. The face-unlock feature works well. Most of the time it would unlock the phone before I could even reach for the fingerprint authentication. Though it doesn't seem to work in dark or low light conditions, which would need an IR scanner. 3. I love all the tweaking and picture controls on the phone. If you are shooting in bokeh mode then one more option ""Color pop"" shows up for the photo which mutes the color around the subject you want to focus on bringing out the colors of the subject. 4. Even though this phone does not have a dedicated camera button, you can still press the power/lock button two times to launch the camera app (this works even if the phone is locked.) Once in the camera app, you can press the volume button (either volume up or down) to take a picture. THINGS YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE 1. This phone produces what is being called as ""Natural looking pictures"". You would want to tweak the pictures with the editing tools provided in this phone to get better-looking pictures.

This is mainly because handling video information from 5 different cameras would have been overwhelming for the phone's hardware. 3. There is no headphone jack.
