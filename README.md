## [Capstone Project:  Feature Extractions and Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/elisenerissa/datascienceportfolio/tree/master/Feature%20Extractions%20and%20Opinions%20Predictions)

- Utilised a state-of-the-art NLP technique, BERT in doing product feature extractions and opinions prediction
- Model was able to detect context and negation factor with 86% accuracy
- Topic clusters were found using an unsupervised learning algorithm (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
- Model was deployed using Docking on Amazon Web Services


## [Project 1: SAT and ACT Data analysis](https://github.com/elisenerissa/datascienceportfolio/tree/master/SAT%20vs%20ACT)

- Data analysis and research to identify states with low participation rate.
- Provide recommendations using data-driven approach on how to improve SAT participation rate

- A Kaggle challenge on predicting housing prices in Ames, Iowa
- Identify top features that affect housing prices in Ames


## [Project 3: COVID-19 Posts Classifier (Natural Language Processing)](https://github.com/elisenerissa/datascienceportfolio/tree/master/Reddit%20Post%20Classification)

- Data Mining using Reddit API to collect posts from different COVID-19 Subreddits
- Analysed the different discussion topics on COVID-19 Subreddits and built a model that can classify post into the right COVID- 19 Subreddit


## [Project 4: West Nile Virus Predictions](https://github.com/elisenerissa/datascienceportfolio/tree/master/West%20Nile%20Virus%20Predictions)
- Created a spraying plan for the city of Chicago to prevent the spread of West Nile Virus
