It came with 100% battery life, so it basically was brand new. It came with a charger and cube (plug), but that's it. Sorry to disappoint those who into that airpod life. No scratches and shipped fairly quickly. The only complaint I have for the iPhone XS, in general, is that I really liked the fingerprint scan, sometimes the face recognition doesn't work when you're looking down. But what it lacks in that feature, the iPhone delivers in the portrait camera mode, I seriously am in love with the blur feature. Sincerely, A very satisfied Amazon customer\n",

First off I’m going to say that I recieved and iPhone xs MAX, not the standard xs like it’s advertised. Not a big deal to me, but it might be to some people. Also as the other review states, it comes with a charger but not the headphones or the headphone adapter. Other than that it looks brand new and came very quickly! Overall very satisfied. Honestly though, since this is the same price as a new xs, I would probably recommend just buying a brand new one instead.\n",

Firstly, this iphone is really like new. Battery life %100. But i don’t believe the charging cable is original. Cuz as seen in the photos, The material is really poor quality, the cable shape is distorted with a slight bending. As is known, it is a factor that affects charging and phone performance.\n",

I really would leave 0 stars if it were possible. Be careful with \"renewed\" phones on Amazon. I left it charging almost 2 whole days and it never turned on. And yes I tried different chargers. Went to different outlets and the phone would never turn on. It also did not look new as mentioned. I will never ever buy a \"renewed\" product off of anyone on Amazon. It is just really frustrating because what if I needed a phone by a certain day and I am relying on Amazon do deliver a perfectly working phone. And now I am unfortunately just involved in a hassle.\n",

I got it for my grandpa who upgraded from an iPhone 6. The 11 was already announced when we got this, but he didn't like the 11 (not pro) because it was bigger and more expensive and the screen on this is a lot better. The phone as a whole is alright. The cameras are what you can expect from an iPhone (awesome). It's just hard to explain to him why it doesn't have a headphone jack and what happened to the fingerprint scanner. If it had those two it'd be a great phone, but it'll have to settle for being just a great iPhone. Also, the price stung a lot. He says sometimes regrets not getting a Samsung S10 because that did have all the features he wanted for less price and arguably similar quality. Yet, he really likes iOS, and that transition would be a little difficult for him. So to wrap it up, if you're tied into the iOS ecosystem, this is a great phone. This can be a good deal over the iPhone 11 pro, especially if you aren't going to be using a wide angle lens.\n",

Scratch was about 1 inch and half. Maybe i had a bad unit. It was clean everywhere else and they put the screen protector on top of the screen But for the price and like new condition it stated on the description it was disappointing.\n",

I gave it a shot and ordered a gold xs 256gb . After receiving the product and started using it I realized that the battery was decreasing rapidly so I rushed and checked the battery life which showed 96% I then received an update from apple which kinda fixed the battery life problem I had to buy a battery case in order to use it for a full day .. my other fault was that I couldn’t increase the volume over 50% or else the speakers would start to distort which is horrible.. I contacted Amazon for a partial refund since I could not return the phone because I’m currently on a business trip but all I got was it wasn’t possible... please be careful when u purchase this item\n",

Works very well. I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 I purchased back in 2015. This phone is a spectacular upgrade and works in every way I want it to. Totally worth buying renewed over new.

WOW! I’m a very skeptical shopper. I thought the description and the price for my phone was too good to be true. My phone was an exact match of the description and I could not be happier. Absolutely spotless, free of marks or scratches. The battery life is currently the same what would be on a new phone. Impressed with the seller’s ability to match a description with the product. I was very skeptical since pictures were not even posted of the phone. I just shopped for months and went with the best seller reviews. Which is why I am choosing to leave you with my experience. No doubt I will buy from this seller again.\n",

I’d rather not wait more time to return it and get a new one since it will just waste time to get an item with the exact same condition back. Phone came with a cheap knockoff lightning charger, only charges on one side and overheats often. Shipping was fast and reliable. Item is great honestly but I would recommend buying the max same storage and everything because it’s the same price with other sellers.\n",

Anytime you see “renewed” you expect something less than new but your not sure how it will compare to new. Honestly in this case you would not know the difference. I was pleasantly surprised. I received this phone yesterday and it is perfect as if I just unboxed a new iPhone XS. The phone powered on and had 100% battery. I am so please with this phone. It also arrived 4 days ahead of the expected delivery date. Thank you CellCow.\n",

When I say this phone came like new, I mean it actually had 0 scratches on it with 100% battery, so that was a nice surprise. I also confirmed with Apple to make sure the phone was real, It’s possible I I just got an excellent previous owner, but from my experience this was well worth it. A+++\n",

Came with 100% battery health (battery was new), packaged well, and came early. After around 5 hours of use everything seems to be working well. Also came with a 90 day warranty.\n",

I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but the phone came in perfect condition. It comes with a charger and box, but like the other reviews said, it doesn’t come with an adapter or the AirPods which was not an issue with me because it was such a good price. Definitely worth the buy, had no issues setting up\n",

Mine however came with 100%. I recommended this phone to anyone looking for a XS in good condition for a good price.\n",

       "63313    Screen and speaker problem Ok I got a space gray iPhone XS with 256GB and I was happy to get it, it came in a odd box but I didn’t really care about that I got the phone and there are dings and scratch’s on The outer metal case of the phone and I can tell that I he front glass and LCD scream were replaced be the screen kinda drags the image like on a old computer we’re the image stays for a second, that was one thing I was annoyed about that but the second thing was that it sound like the bottom speaker was broken at one point and they bought another one but it is a really cheap speaker because at certain points it has a pitch of sound with it and it just doesn’t sound good the speaker next to the Face ID camera works perfectly just the one at the bottom of the phone is really bad me personally I don’t care if it has dings or scratch’s on the outer Metal frame of the phone it just really annoys me when they replace the speaker with a bad one and that they get a cheaper LCD screen just to save a little bit of money I mostly notice the bad cream when I’m scrolling on instagram, Twitter or YouTube it’s when you are scrolling that it is the most noticeable problem wouldn’t buy again if I new they replaced parts with bad ones also battery gets kinda worm/hot when charging or on FaceTime and sometimes just randomly but that may just happen when running powerful or changing so that may just be normal not to sure but the battery stays charged all day so not too worried about the battery\n",

It's also unable to be restored to complete factory reset (through the recovery screen reset method using itunes). I got on the phone with them and they told me to \"Wait a couple of days\" because there's a problem at apple's end. Joke is on them, I talked to apple to try and get this thing updated but no matter what we tried it was impossible. The phone is a dud and they want me to wait a few days? Get real!\n",

Beat down phone. Phone works fine, but the claim “looks like new” is a joke. I tried twice ordering from the same seller and the condition was worse the 2nd time. Covered in scratches and battery life depleted to 86%. Sad, irritating experience and sellers route of recourse was to call a phone number that responded “mailbox full”. Save yourself the frustration and order a phone directly from Apple.\n",

Compared to my 6, it’s different. Took some time getting used to no home screen. Occasionally the data/ wifi connection gets iffy. I still have the same plan as i did w my 6 and still the same circumstances (same home wifi, same job/ school ect) calls/ facetime will occasionally freeze/ sound fuzzy if i am not connected to wifi. That was never a problem with my 6 (my 6 was a GSM unlocked, idk if that has anything to do with it) I wear glass, and sometimes the face ID does not recognize me if i do not have them on. Battery life is great! And i like being able to access low power mode easier than having to go through settings all the time! All in all, good phone. I can tell you one thing, it is not worth $600+. The raw materials used to make iphones are worth less than $10. This was the best price i found for this phone, so thank you!!!\n",

I know the price point is tempting but don’t do it! I just received the iPhone I ordered and it was terrible condition. I’m not sure how it passed their “quality inspection” but it came with scratches all over and with a broken screen... It gets better because now I have to pay for the return shipping. Just save yourself a headache and don’t do it.\n",

The phone I received looks completely brand new (I looked for any defects and I couldn’t find one), the battery health is 100, and the screen is great. I would highly recommend buying this if you’re interested.\n",

       "63217    It's an iPhone This is a great iPhone. I got it for my grandpa who upgraded from an iPhone 6. The 11 was already announced when we got this, but he didn't like the 11 (not pro) because it was bigger and more expensive and the screen on this is a lot better. The phone as a whole is alright. The cameras are what you can expect from an iPhone (awesome). It's just hard to explain to him why it doesn't have a headphone jack and what happened to the fingerprint scanner. If it had those two it'd be a great phone, but it'll have to settle for being just a great iPhone. Also, the price stung a lot. He says sometimes regrets not getting a Samsung S10 because that did have all the features he wanted for less price and arguably similar quality. Yet, he really likes iOS, and that transition would be a little difficult for him. So to wrap it up, if you're tied into the iOS ecosystem, this is a great phone. This can be a good deal over the iPhone 11 pro, especially if you aren't going to be using a wide angle lens.\n",

Scratch was about 1 inch and half. Maybe i had a bad unit. It was clean everywhere else and they put the screen protector on top of the screen But for the price and like new condition it stated on the description it was disappointing.\n",
