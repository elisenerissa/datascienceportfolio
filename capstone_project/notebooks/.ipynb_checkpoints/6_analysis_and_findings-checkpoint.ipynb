    "To conclude, the BERT model performed relatively well in terms of accuracy score. However, I have found some limitations as I was testing the model with many variations of sentences with different sentiments. The limitations are elaborated below. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations #1 (sentiment predictions):**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is predicting words like \"okay\" to be 5 star (To me, I would rate it as 3 or 4 star). This could be because many reviewers who think that certain features are \"okay\" have given a rating of 4 (which is a slightly above average type of rating). As we only fine-tuned the model with 3 classes (negative, neutral, positive), we have categoried 4 star rating to be positive. This explains why the model is giving a 5 star for feature that is described as \"okay\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution #1:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I will consider fine-tuning the model with 5 classes instead as a way to improve the model. Also, I would like to consolidate all the frequently used words/sentences that are not accurately being predicted, label them with the right ratings and add them to the train dataset to fine-tune the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations #2 (feature extractions):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, it is only to search for features with the keywords that I have defined which is pretty limited. It is unable to search for synonym of the keywords. Example, \"this phone takes nice picture\" will not be picked up by the model currently. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution #2:** \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to improve this is to generate all the synonyms of the features and fine-tune the model further. As fine-tuning of BERT model is quite time-consuming, I will work on this improvement in the future.\n",

    "Recapping on the business problem and problem statement that we were trying to address: \n",

    "1. Automatically segregates reviews by topics\n",
    "2. Summarise each review by features and sentiments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have addressed both the problem statements. **The topic modelling that was done in notebook 2 and 3 have identified clear and logical topic clusters** which is definitely useful in segregating reviews on e-commerce platform (eg. Amazon,Lazada,Expedia,Airbnb), especially on popular listing with hundreds/thousands of reviews. This would greatly **enhance user experience.** The **extractions of features and sentiments would also help users extract important information from extremely long reviews, as we have seen on the EDA that there are reviews with about 1000 wordcounts.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the output of features and ratings of each review that we have currently, we can also use it to produce an aggregated rating of each feature within a listing. Example, on iphone XR, the aggregated rating on camera is x, the aggregated rating on screen is y, the aggregated rating on battery is z (calculated from thousands of reviews that it has)."
