**Flair**

When you post please assign flair to your post, especially if you have an account or a story which may trigger some people looking for support.  Thank you!

**Reason for this sub**

It had come to my attention that a lot of news about the epidemic had been causing spikes in anxiety and problems with people's mental health, which really exacerbates the problem.

And with more and more cities going into in lockdown and more people forcing quarantines it seems that mental health is CRITICAL at this point in time. So hence comes this sub. 

**Guidelines**

This is a safe space.  If you see anything insulting or slanderous in a post, comment, or PM, please message the moderators.

Anything that's not a direct, personal, supportive response to the OP is usually flagged and if you cannot post, message the moderators and we'll get you sorted out.

We do not have the ability to trace the source of any posts, and we can't guarantee immediate responses.

We offer non-judgemental peer support not necessarily professional advice.  You can check out [rules and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/about/rules/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=COVID19_support&amp;utm_content=t5_2f6rwj) for more.

Surveys and research participation requests must be pre-approved by the mod team. 

This is seperate from mental health subs like r/depression, r/SuicideWatch and r/anxiety but some information from there will be cross posted here and those subs are always open for additional help.

This is all volunteer and any mod abuse will not be tolerated and will result in a ban.

**Disclaimers**

This is not a professional environment.  Some advice may be given by professionals but it is on a peer to peer basis and not legally binding.

,COVID19_support,"Hi everyone. I’m a 20 year old college student and I just finished my spring semester around a week ago. I lost my job due to the pandemic, live 600 miles away from my family, and have struggled with mental health issues for years. As I’m sure many of you can relate, I’ve never felt this bad.

I feel like I’ve lost all sense of meaning in my life. I don’t have any goals to strive for because everything is up in the air. I’m supposed to graduate early this December, but I’m unsure if classes will even continue in the fall if the situation doesn’t improve. I’m a student studying the music industry, which is already an uncertain field that relies on internships and experience. I have spent the last summers doing these internships and making meaningful connections that would help me in my career. However, there’s no chance of doing that this summer.

I’m just unsure where to go from here. I am without a job, finished with school for the summer, and without internship and career opportunities. My house lost power due to a storm this past week for 4 days which made the situation even worse.

I hate to sound whiny and pessimistic, but I’m so lost right now. I feel stuck. I’m not getting out of bed unless I have to. I’m neglecting my needs and I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt so depressed. If anyone has any words of advice I would appreciate it so much.

,COVID19_support,"I'm living with my spouse and 5 year old kid in a metro in India. I'm writing this because even though I was fine and positive when all this Covid thing started, I'm losing my motivation day by day.

I know am very lucky, privileged to live in a safe place, with my fav people. That I have access to essentials, for now. But off late I have started worrying more and more about the future. Earlier, I was positive and quite calm with whatever happened. But now that I can't see any end to this, I'm losing my hope, day by day. 

I sometimes get anxiety and then instead of thinking up activities for my kid, I just Netflix all day. 

We can't even go out, we are only allowed to go down to the lobby for deliveries. Only people with health issues (physiotherapy or autistic kid) are allowed to walk in the gardens etc. 

My husband got a transfer in his job and we are expected to move after lockdown ends in India. But I'm worried about changing my kids school in the middle of all this, and of finding a new rental apartment in the new city. Societies (gated communities) here are quite strict and authoritarian, so I'm also worried that they may decide to not let any new people rent. That wouldn't have been possible earlier, but with COVID, who knows? Plus my kid.. not only will they have to deal about leaving old friends - without a proper farewell - but there may not be any new play dates or friends anytime soon. And we don't know if or when schools will open. 

I'm sorry, I know this is a huge rant, but I'm just struggling too much and I want to talk about it before it goes out of hand. All the people in my circle are sounding stressed day by day and I don't want to add to their burden. 

Anyway, thank you for reading this. I hope things are better for you, reader. 

Also, sorry if there are any grammatical errors and stuff. English isn't my first language. A lot of 'day-by-day' happening here.

But I&amp;#39;m worried about changing my kids school in the middle of all this, and of finding a new rental apartment in the new city. Societies (gated communities) here are quite strict and authoritarian, so I&amp;#39;m also worried that they may decide to not let any new people rent. That wouldn&amp;#39;t have been possible earlier, but with COVID, who knows? Plus my kid.. not only will they have to deal about leaving old friends - without a proper farewell - but there may not be any new play dates or friends anytime soon. And we don&amp;#39;t know if or when schools will open. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I know this is a huge rant, but I&amp;#39;m just struggling too much and I want to talk about it before it goes out of hand. All the people in my circle are sounding stressed day by day and I don&amp;#39;t want to add to their burden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thank you for reading this. I hope things are better for you, reader. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, sorry if there are any grammatical errors and stuff. English isn&amp;#39;t my first language. A lot of &amp;#39;day-by-day&amp;#39; happening here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: few words&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind, supportive words. Am honestly feeling much better, after reading and being reminded again that we are not alone in this. Hoping we all get out of this stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"My mom is in her early 50s and works in a psychiatric hospital. She works as an administrator in an Alzheimer’s unit. The unit is for Alzheimer’s patients who also have other mental health issues, usually psychosis. You can imagine that this creates patients who are kind of all over the place. She has an office that is right next to the nurses station, so the patients often come to her door and talk to her. A lot of the more lucid ones really like her because she really cares for the patients even though it’s not her job. But a lot of the patients who are really sick have spat at her, hit her, etc. When this whole COVID stuff started she wasn’t working because my 16 year old brother has a congenital heart defect and was getting open heart surgery. Despite the fact that she can work from home, her boss insisted she go back. So long story short she went back out of choice, because she felt like she had to. Even though she’s not a nurse or a doctor, she felt she had to for the patients. The nurses are understaffed, so my mom does a lot for the patients even though it’s not her job.

Well now this hospital has a full on outbreak of COVID and they don’t know how or why. My moms unit seems to be getting hit hard, I guess because it’s hard to quarantine confused Alzheimer’s patients. Apparently 3 days ago my mom came into contact with a patient. She was walking by and the patient grabbed her, and my mom stopped and held this patients hand and tried to comfort the patient. Yesterday the patient started showing symptoms. Today this patient tested positive for COVID. The only thing my mom was wearing when the patient grabbed her was a flimsy cloth mask that were donated to the hospital. 

Sorry for the novel, I guess that’s enough context lol. I am just really nervous for my mom. If she dies, I will have no parents left. Her doctor suspects she has early stage COPD, she has hypertension, and she has prediabetes. So she’s not in the worst of health, but she’s not in great health either. 

The worst part is if she does get COVID Ill never be able to see her. I have a chronic lung disease and I’m at a super high risk, so I haven’t seen her in 2 months. The last time I saw her was at the hospital for my brothers surgery, the next day everything shut down and I wasn’t allowed to visit. 

I’m just scared. There’s nothing to do but wait and hope she doesn’t get sick. If she dies I’ll have no parents left and that’s scary. I’m only 24. Wtf am I supposed to do without anyone? What is my brother supposed to do? My kid needs his grandma. But my mom needs a job.

,COVID19_support,"Hi there,

Having read through many of the posts on this subreddit for the past few months, I wanted to make you guys something to help bring a little light to your day. With 200+ videos to its name, the ""For You"" playlist covers a wide spectrum, from moments that make you proud to be human, to showcases of incredible inventions, creativity, and ingenuity, to a cat in a shark suit riding a Roomba. I intend to keep adding videos until it totals 24 hours, so I can give you guys a literal day's worth of reasons to smile, to laugh, to be inspired, and to hope.  

Below is a link to the playlist. There's a lot to choose from, so my advice would be to pick a video with a title and/or thumbnail that interests you most, and go from there. Otherwise, just start from the beginning and let the good times roll!

,COVID19_support,"Like the post says, my mom is in the hospital. She was extremely weak on Tuesday morning, and we wound up calling EMS to come get her so she could be looked at, and things have spiraled from there. She tested negative for COVID thankfully, but they've found vegetation on her mitral valve in her heart, abscesses in her knee and ankle, pneumonia, positive blood cultures, and they're going to MRI her brain to see if the infection spread there. She's currently on a vent, and is set to have a mitral valve replacement on Monday, and neither me nor my father can be there for her, because of this pandemic. 

I worked at the same hospital last night on a different floor, so thankfully I got to peak in on her. I even got to go in her room for a minute after my awful shift and talk to her while she was intubated. She looked at me when I talked and told her of all the people who called to support her, and how we all missed her and hoped she would improve. And then after I left work, I broke down and cried like I haven't in decades. 

There's a chance she might die Monday. I might have been the last family face she sees before it happens. Not her husband of 30 years.  Not her sister. Not her great nephews who she thinks the absolute world of. Just me. Exhausted and on the verge of tears telling her to be strong. And even though it had to be me, I thank my lucky stars that she at least saw a familiar face, because it's a luxury that not many others can get in these times. 

I have a doctor's appointment Monday that I have to cancel because I might have to plan for a funeral instead. I don't even know how funerals operate right now. I don't know who should come and who should stay if anyone can come.

Should I/we get tested? Links to articles that support/oppose this would be much appreciated, thank you for your time and stay safe. &lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"As a healthy 21-year-old guy in good shape with an immune system that has proven strong in the past while my grandparents are well cared for by my cousins in a separate apartment, I feel I should really just shut up and be grateful for the advantage life gave me in this pandemic. And trust me, I really am.

It’s just that two worries continue to plague me, and if there’s anyone more informed in this subreddit than me on these topics, I’d give my life for them to dispel my fears so I can finally focus my mind on more productive things.

First off, the economic and political fallout of this all. I realise that the reason for the lockdowns is that in the end, by doing nothing, we’d be _more_ financially screwed as a society through the excess death and a lot of the workforce being knocked out by illness. I just feel like a lockdown messed up my generation’s future by hurling us right into a looming, bleak, financial crisis. Exacerbating all the inequality that is already in place right now, having the big players cannibalise small businesses… Hell I’m going to graduate from university right into it, and there’s just a feeling of dread making its rounds in my heart sensing that my future was just stolen from me… and then there’s a threatening climate crisis right on track to stretch its ugly claws out for all humans. Worst of all is, compared to the West China is looking like it’s going to come out on top of it. I do not want the money I spend (once I have enough disposable income to make a difference) contributing to the global geopolitical hegemony of a genocidal dictatorship. I realise the USA as the World’s current superpower are far from ideal as well, but a democracy with (admittedly very serious) flaws pulling the strings is something I’m much more comfortable with than the comic book villain state that is the PRC.

Additionally, at least here in Germany conspiracy theories and general Covid nutjobbery are on a dangerous rise. People I would have never expected to fall for those are now happily sending images and sketchy blog posts around, opening the sheep’s eyes about the virus being a bioweapon and Bill Gates and so on and so on. It’s really hard arguing against those convictions with just the plain, boring facts. Celebrities are coming out in support of the former. I’m downright scared that conspiracist idiocy is going to establish itself in the political discourse here for good. Imagine if the local right-wing populist please-don’t-call-us-nazis party picks the movement up. In some countries that would already tip the scales in a very sad direction for democracy; hell, the Dear Leader of Hungary did already use this crisis to establish the country as his very own playground. I don’t want to live in a far-right Europe some five years down the line; if there’s anything I personally have learnt from Covid, then that I must apologise to all you Americans for thinking that that post-satirical, facepalm-inducing kind of populism and paranoid conspiracism would only affect you guys. This crisis has awoken me to the fact European societies are just as vulnerable to those. I keep reading how devastating pandemics leave behind a more just world, how progress happens at the tail of disaster; meanwhile, all I can do is fear for the future. The liberal democracy is a fairly young experiment in the grand scale of time, and I don’t want such a preventable thing to be its final blow. Please tell me that I’m overreacting, I beg you.

Now, for a very personal fear – long-term damage after mild illness. Lung capacity can be reduced for a long time by this in rare cases, sure, and I am wary of this, but there’s therapy for that, and admittedly I’ve never been that much of an athlete. I’m not afraid for my own lifestyle when it comes to that. However, the reports of SARS-CoV-2 wreaking havoc in men’s testicles are still wreaking havoc on my emotions all day… has there been any research on that? Has any team of scientists gone out to collect sperm samples of recovered patients, including “mild” and asymptomatic ones, to soothe that fear? That must be an easy thing to conduct, right? Because, as admittedly laughable as that may sound to you, for the life of me I am afraid of becoming an unlucky victim to some mass infertility. This virus has already robbed me of my job prospects, don’t tell me it’s robbing me of my reproductive prospects as well. Like… the thing about permanent lung damage is that there have been enough recovered cases going about their usual sports again in total that it would be way bigger news if it were anything more than minuscule, but the last time I checked it was quite unusual for people to do sperm tests after recovering from a fever. The virus has already showed us that it behaves in unexpected ways in the body via blood clotting and strokes, so there… _is_ the possibility that COVID-19 left large swathes of infected men sterile and that we just haven’t discovered that, right? Please tell me I’m off the rails here.

I guess what I wanted with this post was to just write these worries off my mind (that’s one thing off the to-do list now at least!) and wait for one of the super-smart and super invested people roaming this sub to send a few links my way debunking all those spectres of my brain.

,COVID19_support,"I can't tell anymore if I am overreacting to covid-19 or if my feelings are realistic. My feelings towards all the ""we should NEVER go back to normal"" or ""this IS the new normal"" people is just -- ???????.

I'm a college student, living away from my parents, who is now jobless. I was working for my university, and was supposed to graduate next year. I had a great job in the IT department, and by the time I graduated would have had 3 years of IT experience to get a better job in a better city. My current city has very little jobs available because everything's closed or on limited operations. We're not LA or Silicon Valley, we're a little midwestern town. My only options are McDonald's and Walmart now.

My classes have moved online and I am failing 2 of them, a big change from A's and B's. My uni still has no concrete plans to get back to in-person schooling, and my job won't be back until ""maybe august"". OK but I need money!! I don't qualify for stimulus money because my parents claim me, and I don't qualify for unemployment.

Everyone else around me is like, elated to stay at home. They're happy to be on reduced hours, or staying at home and still getting paid. Even the friends who don't have jobs are having no issues. And god forbid I complain, because the same people are posting about how if you want things to change you're a piece of shit who is killing their grandma. Everyone's pressuring me to stick it out, but the odds of me getting my job and old life back are none if we'll be doing this ""off and on"" quarantine for the next 2 years like everyone's saying.

Idk I feel really depressed and angry! I'm skeptical that there will be economic support for my degree by the time I graduate, and if there is it will likely be ""work from home"" which I absolutely will not do. I can't continue studying/working/LIVING online, the instruction is abysmal and soooo not what I paid thousands of dollars for. I have to pay for rent, food, everything. I have parents and grandparents and a girlfriend too, who are at risk for covid-19. Plus I'm transgender, so I have to pay for my own medical care, and no I don't have family to support me. Sorry I don't have mommy and daddy to fall back on like every other unemployed/college 20's person seemingly does. But I'm the self centered piece of trash if I feel bad about this quarantine or wishing to at LEAST leave my house and enjoy the brief company of others to distract from the fact that my life is fucking broke and upended :)

I don't have a lot of needs. I'm an introvert, I'm frugal, and I had modest ambitions to get a house and start a family someday. But now I feel like it'll never happen, and I'm a horrible person for mourning that. I'm sorry this is such a downer I just can't stand seeing everyone so happy and unaffected by this.

My toddlers behaviour has been terrible at times but I stead for being furious with her I have to remember her little world has been turned upside down. No seeing friends, no play groups, no park, no nursery school, no days with her nanna which she loves and no seeing her cousins.

,COVID19_support,"Met a girl in late February. We started talking, basically nonstop. Felt like we were hitting it off. Mid-March, after some deliberation, I pushed the ""do we like each other"" issue. We did. After that, we hung out basically once before COVID came to the forefront and locked everything down. At first we said we were gonna try to make it work. She seemed as enthusiastic as I was. I was scared about being on lockdown for awhile and not seeing each other, but I wanted to make it work. I thought we could. Late March, I guess a switch flipped for her. Said she was scared of getting into a relationship due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, and she's also starting a stressful new job in mid-May and is afraid of what her availability will be. Legitimate concerns. I don't blame her. Things are stressful. We said that maybe we'll reconsider continuing it when things get back to normal (I feel like these kinds of things never pan out, but I suppose this is particularly weird time) and made promises to remain friends (which has gone about as well as you'd expect; we ping each other here and there but it's super awkward).

And she's right. I can't fault her. Trying to navigate a new relationship right now would suck. But having it ripped away from me sucks too. I really liked this girl and I feel like my chance of getting a fair shot was ripped away from me through no fault of my own. I struggle finding people I really connect with, and this stings. The timing has been comically bad. It's hard not to be furious about the situation.

If things were ""normal"", I would've been able to wallow in self-pity for a little bit, but then get back to normal life and do things to distract me. Now, I'm just stuck in a house and I've been totally unable to get this off of my mind. It's been awhile now so I don't really feel sad anymore, I just feel empty. I hate how nebulous everything feels. When can I see my friends again? When can I resume some semblance of normalcy? Is there actually going to be a time when I can attempt to rekindle this? Generally it helps me in life to pick something in the future and look forward to it, whether it's a big event or just hanging out with friends the next weekend or something. But with so much uncertainty it doesn't feel like I have anything to look forward to. It's just me, alone, working and killing time until I have to work again, indefinitely.

I consider myself overall lucky in this pandemic. I have a good job where I've just gone full WFH. I don't have economic concerns or anything. I'm lucky to be well off in this respect and I'm grateful for that. I still really hate this. I hate how I've had a potentially good thing ripped away from me, I hate how little control I have over my own life right now, and I hate how uncertain my future looks.

,COVID19_support,"Had a very vivid dream last night that I was walking through the entrance plaza at Disneyland, but I was wearing PPE and the place was 90% empty, which in Disneyland terms is ""fucking deserted"". Everyone was wearing a mask, and I was walking towards the entrance, but all I could think was how much I needed to run, that it wasn't safe, that at any time someone around me could drop dead. By the time I got to the front gate, I felt sick, like someone was forcing me to go in at gunpoint and knew this was a twisted way to kill me. I was looking at these happy children and families and watching them walk to their deaths.

,COVID19_support,"I have had a resurgence of OCD (something I beat over 20 years ago) and health anxiety with this pandemic.

,COVID19_support,"I have been in lockdown since mid-March in NYC and for these past two weeks, I have been very depressed about lockdown and feeling the social isolation and lack of hope. First, I have to acknowledge that I am one of the lucky ones -- I live with my partner and two cats and we both still have our jobs. Our apt has outdoor space. I have a good set of friends and we have been doing the whole video hang thing. And my family is safe and healthy even though we are not close. But more and more, I have been feeling lonely, sad and miserable about being in lockdown. I don't want to get into the nuances of why a video chat is not the same as an in personal interaction, but a zoom happy hour is not the same as going to happy hour at a bar with a group of friends. You know, when a few people show up and you first end up sitting in a circle but then more people arrive, people start standing, and groups splinter off. A hang in which you can huddle in a corner gossiping or in which someone can impromptu order shots. These virtual interactions can't replace the intimacy of the human touch or simply getting out of the house and feeling free of work/household chores/etc. Hell, I even miss going to the office and having stupid, petty small talk in the office kitchen. I miss getting onto a packed subway train and everyone rolling their eyes when someone holds the door open. I miss going to the gym and booking exercise classes. I miss all the small and beautiful things that made NYC the city I always wanted to live in and never leave.

It's gotten to the point where I am looking for any opportunity to go outside and possibly even see people in person. I know that the lockdown is the right thing to do and I support all of Cuomo's criteria for reopening NYC on a logical level. But the idea of not having NYC fully reopen until September or even next year makes me want to jump off a bridge. I believe in science and trust the advice of experts. But with the way I have been feeling, I am really, really inclined to break the rules and organize a small picnic in the park or have people over. It doesn't help that both my partner and I had COVID in March and probably have some immunity, even if not scientifically proven. I'm all the more frustrated because I believe that the federal government really fucked up, from not taking an active step in January to not simply locking the whole country down for 1.5 months so that we can reopen quicker and earlier. This article ([https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/stop-waiting-miracle/610795/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/stop-waiting-miracle/610795/)) summarizes how I am seeing this whole thing and if everything is so fucked and there is no hope, I just want to be selfish and feel better and I don't want to feel bad for doing it.

One hiccup is that a lot of my friends don't live near me or have left the city for lockdown. It means any meetup would require some subway travel to a mutually convenient location and the willingness of my friends, and I am just not sure who would be down or who wouldn't.

On top of this, I had been really, really looking forward to a 2.5 week international, multi-country vacation this year. I was in a very grueling graduate program for the past few years and graduated last year. I went straight into taking a very difficult licensing exam and then started my current job, which has been relentlessly demanding. This trip was the light at the end of my tunnel--a way for me to finally celebrate my graduation and to decompress fully from work. Now thanks to this pandemic, my travel plans are totally ruined. An inter-US trip may not be possible given the state of things and quarantine restrictions. And I seriously have no interest in doing a car road trip near NYC because I've seen a lot of it and I'm frankly just not interested in this part of the country anymore. So there is no light at the end of this tunnel, no friends or in-person hangouts to be had, and NYC may not even open its beaches. I understand logically and on an intellectual level that social distancing and locking is necessary to keep essential workers and the most vulnerable safe. I understand that medical workers are exhausted and need our help in flattening the curve. I am saddened by all the death. But I am also mentally losing it and don't know how to keep on.

I have a good set of friends and we have been doing the whole video hang thing. And my family is safe and healthy even though we are not close. But more and more, I have been feeling lonely, sad and miserable about being in lockdown. I don&amp;#39;t want to get into the nuances of why a video chat is not the same as an in personal interaction, but a zoom happy hour is not the same as going to happy hour at a bar with a group of friends. You know, when a few people show up and you first end up sitting in a circle but then more people arrive, people start standing, and groups splinter off. A hang in which you can huddle in a corner gossiping or in which someone can impromptu order shots. These virtual interactions can&amp;#39;t replace the intimacy of the human touch or simply getting out of the house and feeling free of work/household chores/etc. Hell, I even miss going to the office and having stupid, petty small talk in the office kitchen. I miss getting onto a packed subway train and everyone rolling their eyes when someone holds the door open. I miss going to the gym and booking exercise classes. I miss all the small and beautiful things that made NYC the city I always wanted to live in and never leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s gotten to the point where I am looking for any opportunity to go outside and possibly even see people in person. I know that the lockdown is the right thing to do and I support all of Cuomo&amp;#39;s criteria for reopening NYC on a logical level. But the idea of not having NYC fully reopen until September or even next year makes me want to jump off a bridge. I believe in science and trust the advice of experts. But with the way I have been feeling, I am really, really inclined to break the rules and organize a small picnic in the park or have people over. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that both my partner and I had COVID in March and probably have some immunity, even if not scientifically proven. I&amp;#39;m all the more frustrated because I believe that the federal government really fucked up, from not taking an active step in January to not simply locking the whole country down for 1.5 months so that we can reopen quicker and earlier. This article (&lt;a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/stop-waiting-miracle/610795/""&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/stop-waiting-miracle/610795/&lt;/a&gt;) summarizes how I am seeing this whole thing and if everything is so fucked and there is no hope, I just want to be selfish and feel better and I don&amp;#39;t want to feel bad for doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hiccup is that a lot of my friends don&amp;#39;t live near me or have left the city for lockdown. It means any meetup would require some subway travel to a mutually convenient location and the willingness of my friends, and I am just not sure who would be down or who wouldn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, I had been really, really looking forward to a 2.5 week international, multi-country vacation this year. I was in a very grueling graduate program for the past few years and graduated last year. I went straight into taking a very difficult licensing exam and then started my current job, which has been relentlessly demanding. This trip was the light at the end of my tunnel--a way for me to finally celebrate my graduation and to decompress fully from work. Now thanks to this pandemic, my travel plans are totally ruined. An inter-US trip may not be possible given the state of things and quarantine restrictions. And I seriously have no interest in doing a car road trip near NYC because I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of it and I&amp;#39;m frankly just not interested in this part of the country anymore. So there is no light at the end of this tunnel, no friends or in-person hangouts to be had, and NYC may not even open its beaches. I understand logically and on an intellectual level that social distancing and locking is necessary to keep essential workers and the most vulnerable safe. I understand that medical workers are exhausted and need our help in flattening the curve. I am saddened by all the death. But I am also mentally losing it and don&amp;#39;t know how to keep on. All I want is for some normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;

in the Decameron by 14th-century Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, a group of ten young women and men tell each other stories during isolation due to the black plague epidemic.

The protagonists of the Decameron find relief in collective storytelling, I thought of starting a project to encourage a parallel dynamic by converting the short stories by Boccaccio into small playable modules for the most recent version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

I'm freaking scared. I don't know what I would do if I lost her, I'm just not ready for that. She's a strong woman, just last year did a crazy mountain climbing journey that I don't think I could even do. But from what I can tell, people like her are still getting wiped out. We've all been taking Vitamin D since this started, so I hope that helps.

Honestly I don't even see how she hasn't been infected yet, with the stories she comes home with. I won't go into detail really since I don't think that's allowed. But the exposure is incredible and if this virus is truly as infectious as it seems to be, I can't even comprehend how she hasn't caught it yet.

Every day I have so much anxiety because I'm waiting for her to start coming down with it. When she goes to work I have a lot of anxiety because I'm worried she will catch it. And I know she is scared too, which makes me sad.

We both have asthma, but would both be classified as mild. Neither of us really ever use our inhalers. Hers used to be much worse than mine ever was, but now I think hers is a bit better than mine. For both of us it's just exercise that induces it, and it never progresses to asthma attacks. Nonetheless, I guess it counts as an underlying condition.

I find myself constantly trying to calculate her risk, and I know its just not possible to do that. I just have to hope really hard that if she catches it, it will be mild. I really hope that she has already caught it and was just asymptomatic. I really, really hope for that.

I'm also going back to work soon. I'm an essential employee but took a voluntary leave to try to protect my coworkers since my household has so much exposure. But I have to go back. I'm going to always wear a mask and try to be really careful because some of my coworkers live with their elderly parents with underlying conditions. I would stay away, but my work needs me to come back now and I don't want to lose my job.

Looking at the IFR, I feel like I shouldn't be so afraid. The chances are very good that if my mom gets it, she will be okay. But it just doesn't FEEL like that. It feels like if she gets it, she will die. I can't help but feel like that and be afraid.

Don't even ask about masks. Maybe 0.1% are wearing them. 

What is the fucking point of me even trying if people swarm around me like flies to shit? Reaching over me, brushing up against me, pushing by me in stores... 

I have resigned myself to the fact that I will very, VERY LIKELY contract Covid. Social distancing only works if people LET YOU distance. If you back up, but they come at you anyway, you can't do it. If they trap you in line, you can't do it. If they pass you on the isle, you can't do it. If they reach over you, around you, under you, you can't do it. Sure, I could say something. I'd be telling people to stay back every 3 feet. And some people just don't listen. 

But honestly, fuck me. I'm worried about my grandpa. He'll get it too because motherfuckers have no respect or intelligence.

I am seriously considering just giving up. If only one person is following the rules, how the actual hell could it make any difference? My grandpa is done trying to follow the rules, too. Our state is dumb as fuck. They set all these ""rules"" in place and then never enforced them even though they claim they did. They praised people for doing a good job social distancing when other states were making fun of us for being one of the worst states at social distancing. 

I can't even keep myself safe. How am I supposed to keep everyone else safe? It literally feels like a zombie hoard out there!!! No masks, no personal space AT ALL, and no safety. 

So, y'all tell me... If I'm literally the only one doing anything right... does it even matter at all? I'm so tired of killing myself when it feels like it doesn't matter at all. I am exhausted. I am stressed as fuck. I am scared. My world is suddenly scary. Mundane shit is stressful now. I don't want to lose my grandpa... But it's like others are hell-bent on taking him from me.

,COVID19_support,"I've worked at the same company for 20+ years in the San Francisco Bay Area and am in middle management. I have been working from home since mid-March. I am terrified of having to return to the office too soon. I am especially concerned since Gov. Newsom announced a transition to the first phase of re-opening tomorrow. I don't know when my county will make any changes to their stay-at-home policy. This is just ""phase 2"" and he says that ""phase 3"" that includes office workers who could work from home is months away. Still, I think every day about whether I will quit my job if we open sooner than I consider safe. It is a huge distraction. I have been at the company my entire career and moving would probably be a step back career-wise.

Today the new twist is that the office in which many of my team members work is apparently opening in three weeks. It is in a different country, so I don't know a lot about the local situation there. There is no word yet about what precautions will be in place. We got something general about mitigation from corporate, but nothing about how that will be applied locally. I suppose I will know more when the HR rep in that office sends the official notification.

My dilemma there is that I don't set the policy requiring people to come into the office, but I would not feel comfortable enforcing it on people who are afraid. I'm also not the direct supervisor of anyone in that office, I'm in-between their direct manager and those making the decision about the policy, so in theory I'm not directly involved in setting or enforcing the policy, unless something gets escalated to me. But I don't feel comfortable playing any role in forcing people to work if they feel unsafe. I feel I should be advocating for them.

,COVID19_support,"So, I’m a nursing student getting my BSN. My school is planning to resume in-person classes this fall and I’m not sure if I should attend. Fall 2020 will be the start of my senior year and it is critically important. I moved to a new city at the beginning of this journey and we live in a cramped one bed, one bath apartment. My fiancé is immunocompromised and is a high-risk individual for COVID-19. 


Unfortunately, his grandmother passed away a couple of weeks ago. He was extremely close to her and his family is offering to let us live in her home rent-free (3 beds, 2 bathrooms, full basement and garage) if we want to move back home which is about 3 hours away. He really wants to go back as it will give us significantly more room and we’ll be closer to his family in case we need anything (no-contact, just like maybe a medicine drop off on the porch or groceries). I honestly want to go back too, as I am sick and tired of being trapped in this cramped apartment. 


I’m also terrified of being crammed with ~50 other students this fall in a tiny classroom and possibly having to deal with clinicals and being around patients without the guarantee of proper PPE (although our program still isn’t sure if we’ll be able to do clinicals yet or not). 


But this fall will be the start of my last year, God willing. And I’ve already had to postpone graduating by a semester due to being unsuccessful in one class at the beginning of my nursing education. I’m afraid if we move back home, I won’t continue with this or that I’ll feel like a failure for postponing graduation again. But I’m terrified of putting my fiancé at risk for contracting this. I’m his only in-person support for his illness at this time, and his primary caretaker as well when he’s experiencing flare-ups, so living separately isn’t really the best idea for what he needs. 


I’ve also been experiencing severe mental health issues since the start of this pandemic. It’s really affected my ability to study and just function as a human being. And nursing school is making it worse, to be honest. We’re dealing with finals this week, so I know it’s nearly over, but I know the fall will just bring the added stress back to my already heightened anxiety.

Its only harder to breathe when im focusing on it which i also assume is a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;

My dilemma is I'd like to get tested too, so we can assess how we live our lives in our home - do we NEED to quarantine from each other because I'm not infected, or can we go back to being in close contact because I am infected?
Our daughter is nine months old and I'd like her to be tested for the same reasoning.
But it feels incredibly selfish to potentially ""take away"" those tests for someone else if by chance my husband is not infected with COVID19.
At the same time, not having my husband able to help with the baby is extremely taxing.
I can see pros and cons to both sides.

,COVID19_support,"I feel like life is punishing me because I’m me. No matter what I do right in my life, I can rarely ever be rewarded. I understand others have it worse but I can’t stop feeling sorry for myself. I feel so alone and isolated. I remember being so anxious about this virus in January, it was all I read about. I got scared and took pre cautions, every sanitary measure. I thought if I’m not being ignorant about this virus and do my part, I will be okay. 

Last month my parents, mom 53 diabetic, dad with no conditions but 67 years, told me to take off work since I work with patients. It’s a pain center so no one comes in “sick”, just in physical pain. I got prescribed anxiety meds because of coronavirus scares alone. I told my coworker I was going to ask to take off, and got back lash from her because I was “too scared” to come into work (I was scared for my parents, it’s not a serious job). I took longer to ask time off bc I felt judged, and eventually got the virus the *week* that I requested. It seems more ironic that I’m the most worried about it so of fucking course I would get it over other people who don’t care. 

Then my worse fears came true, I gave it to my mom. I feel like it’s my fault if anything happens to them. Every day I wake up more anxious because I’m scared something will happen to both of them. I recovered with such a mild case and she’s around day 11, said she’s feeling better, no cough just fatigue. Now, I have to turn my efforts to helping my dad, who isn’t tested yet but most likely would’ve gotten it from us. He has no symptoms yet. I feel so isolated to tell my friends because they would just gossip about me and how I have the virus. I have become emotionally codependent to my significant other and feel helpless. 

I made a plan to turn my life around and apply for grad school before all of this. Every plans that I’ve made for myself has fallen through.  I wish it can all be over. I can’t take another day of planning worst case scenarios in my head. All I can ask is why? Why did it not make a difference how hard I tried to avoid this? Where did I fuck up? I don’t want to feel like I did this to my parents if anything happens to them, but I know I will. I haven’t been the luckiest person my whole life and this just made me feel much worse, like no matter what I do I will always get the short end of the stick because I’m *me*.  I ask myself why it can’t be one of those people who are constantly going out and are fearless? I just hope they will be okay. It hasn’t been 2 weeks since I’ve been recovered but I feel like I’m always waking up in a nightmare where my parents will get severe. 

Anyone out there who has any situation, mild or 
severe, I hope you’re fighting out there as well. It sucks and I hope we get through it in one peace, even if it means our mental health has seriously deteriorated.

,COVID19_support,"Hi, community. While this is a new Reddit account, I have been a Reddit lurker since 2011 so I'm hoping that I get this right. I have been struggling through my COVID recovery and I've been feeling really lost, so I am hoping that talking it out with you all will help. Please excuse any formatting errors!

I was infected with COVID on March 26. My roommate (who is a bit of a conspiracy theorist) was having guests over to our house during lockdown and even recorded a Tiny Desk Concert submission with her band in our house while we were supposed to be quarantined. Her boyfriend, who believes that the virus is all in our heads and is caused by 5G, was the one who brought it over and even though neither he nor my roommate got sick, I did. 

It never got terrible for me, so I didn't go to the hospital. I just had a few nights where I was scared to sleep because my lungs were heavy and painful, and I was having very short breaths. However, during my recovery, I have had to take my comprehensive exams for grad school and I have had to complete an incredibly high-stakes project at work. I have been so stressed out trying to complete my last semester of grad school and not screw up at work, all the while dealing with lingering, painful symptoms, money issues (my side business as a DJ is dead during lockdown and I have been ordering so much food because I feel too weak to cook and I can't go anywhere to shop), and a roommate who believes that 5G caused this. She has been playing some kind of noisemaking device that emits a high-pitched tone that is supposedly keeping her room safe. 

My boss and I don't really get along either. She has been very hard on me through all of this, and didn't tell the office that I was sick (as I asked to to do) so everyone just thought I was taking vacation during this difficult project. When my COVID test came back negative, I went to my doctor and she told me that the test was likely taken too early and the cheek swabs can be inaccurate anyway. She diagnosed me because I have experienced literally all of the symptoms, but when I told my boss this she said, ""Well, it's not like your doctor is a COVID expert, so in the interest of not scaring people who were around you in the office, why don't you take vacation time instead of sick time, and we can say it's because you are preparing for your exams?"" She has since acted like I have been faking this whole thing. I feel like I am going crazy. 

Add to that, I haven't been able to see or hold or kiss my loved ones in over a month. I missed getting to celebrate my dad's, nephew's, and boyfriend's birthdays with them in April and I have been completely alone during recovery, aside from my roommate and her random guests (she has started keeping them on the porch now, but they are still coming into our house to use the restroom). 

Overall, I'm just feeling really vulnerable and trying to muster the motivation to heal. I'm scared of my lungs being permanently maimed by this and all I want to do is be kissed again and go sing karaoke with my friends and go for a long swim. I don't have the money to quit my job or move, and it's not like I can do either while I am sick. Today I set up appointments with a resume consultant and a therapist, and I made this account to see if writing it out can help at all. I appreciate you reading this far, and I'm sorry if it just came off like I am throwing a pity party for myself. There is no one else in my life dealing with COVID recovery so I figured I would give this a whirl as a healthy coping mechanism.

,COVID19_support,"So, hi! If you're reading this, I hope you're safe and sound.

Back  story: My bf and I are together for almost 4 years and we're working in  the same university campus. Our family and friends are in the same city  as the university. We both have rooms on site, so we're not living  together but we're very close to each other during weekdays. On saturdays he works and the rest of the weekend he usually rests. He sees  his friends and parents maybe once every 1-1.5 months. On the other  hand, I go visit my friends and parents on every weekend, unless some  emergency comes up. We usually spend time on weekday evenings and very  rarely on weekends. This is our usual life, for the past 3+ years. The  rooms on campus are in fact just small rooms (15 m2 with bathroom  included and common kitchen facilities that you share with a minimum of 8  other people), therefore not really comfortable for isolation  situations.

Due to COVID19, we're  told to work from home if/when we can (Most of the work we do is in a  laboratory setting). I spoke with my boss and went to my parent's home  about 6 weeks ago. My bf was going in to the office but was hoping to go  to his parent's house as quickly as possible. His parents are around 65ish, his father has hypertension, his mother has no chronical illnesses that I know. About 5.5 weeks ago, he  spoke with a person who was in contact (safe distance away, but still)  with a positive case (the person my bf talked with was in contact with a  positive case). Both my bf and that person showed no symptoms. My bf  decided he'll spend some quarantine time in rooms of the university.

Currently,  he's still at the university rooms and he's very anxious to go to his  parents'. He's telling me he's been using the common kitchens and  cooking and eating with others on his floor. He doesn't feel great,  can't sleep, has occasional slight fever, no coughing, no sneezing. He  tells me the time passes extremely slowly and most of the suggestions I  already made (""let's watch something!"" ""did you see this book?"" ""I'm  reading this, do you want a copy?"" ""look at this comic strip hehe"") were  shot down, saying he can't focus. He's been taking some vitamin C and  has slight sore throat, which is his usual allergies around April. He's  afraid he'll transmit something to his parents.

I  dropped by to his building last week, he was an emotional mess. We  write to each other everyday and I try to get him to talk to process his  emotions but he's not very talkative normally and this situation isn't  helping much. He emailed the university's psychological support center,  and was waiting for a response. I got him a friend's psychologist's  phone number in case he wants to talk somebody online.

What  can I do to make him feel comfortable, loved and safe? I feel if he  goes to his parents', things will be a little bit better but not fully  recovered. How should I help?

A little bit later, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/g7m028/my_incarcerated_dad_fell_ill_to_the_virus_hes_not/) with an update on his condition. He was suffering from kidney failure at that point, which was responded to with dialysis. At first, he responded well to it and appeared to be showing progress for a couple days.

However, earlier today I was informed that after all of the doctor's best efforts, they had determined he would no longer be able to be saved after suffering so much damage to his body and the doctors took him off the ventilator.

I don't even know what to think. I feel like I'm going insane.

Ever since he began his sentence, my dad made sure to call me all the time and we were always writing letters. He's turned me into the person I am today, from my beliefs, personality, and even my dreams in life. He was my best friend and supported me no matter what. His father and his step father were both shit, and he wanted me to have the father he wished he could have had. 

And now I've lost him for a second time. Even after all these years we patiently waited, stayed strong while we passed the time of his sentence, after we talked about all the things we were gonna do when he got out and how we were get him caught up with how things are out in the world.

The patients yell at me as they are getting very discouraged, it's been months since they've been able to do as they wish. 3 have passed away, not of covid, but it is still hard to see. I'm watching and helping nurses put on the intense PPE as it's finally hit our area and we have to be so careful. It feels like a horror movie with the way we look. Sometimes I look and realise we're all in masks, the nurses in goggles and N95 gear on, it feels so dystopian. Despite that, the workers are still mean and I'm always yelled at for messing up, forgetting things like milk on the carts, but I can't just leave when they need me. The government promised an extra 4$ an hour but it hasn't arrived in our facility yet so I'm not making enough money to make it to the next term for school in the fall, much less the extra summer class I need to take now that I know i'm not passing the class with the overdue essay. it's been too long now, I am getting a zero on this assignment, I just know it. There's talk of me having to move into the retirement home I work in full time if things get worse. I was supposed to take a job at a museum that was full time for the summer. The hiring process was frozen though.

I don't know how to handle rent. I've always lived with my parents, and spent the first 2 terms of school on campus.  I paid 700$ as a deposit and was expecting to move into my first ever apartment this fall. Now my school likely won't be open and if I can't cancel my lease early I'm stuck paying for a home I won't be seeing until my 3rd year of school due to the way my program works with co-op.  I gained nearly all the weight I had been losing working on my dreams of being an entertainer during university. 2 months ago I was writing music, in the piano room, dancing, and studying with my friends. I was planning on how to decorate my first home and getting ready to meet my first ever roommates. Now i'm back at home and feel like a kid again, every day is exhausting, I feel like my mom doesn't get it bc it's just 3 hours shifts so she's frustrated i'm not finishing my essay. Then I feel even worse because I'm 19 and shouldn't still be mad at my mother for not ""getting"" me, I should be long past that. I just don't know how to tell my mom I can't bring myself to care about my schoolwork anymore, or even passing my final class. All I want to do is play animal crossing but I don't have the money for that. My old coping mechanism at university was to shop with my friends, but I can't even calm down with online shopping because no parcels are arriving, I have no money, and my friends all went back home.

,COVID19_support,"the pandemic feels like it's never going to end.

i mean, it will realistically. even the black plague and the spanish flu ended. even though i've only been in quarantine since mid March, it's felt like years. people are saying that this virus probably won't pass in any meaningful way for another year or so, which is extremely depressing to hear but sounds accurate given the timetables. while i'm aware that i've lived many years of my life, i don't know how we as a society will cope, let alone my own individual self, with another year of disruptive social distancing.

i'm worried that even if we remove the lockdowns, even after COVID stops being a constantly-consuming threat to our society, we'll be too deeply traumatized to return to any sort of ""normal.""

i consider myself an extroverted person, but i really miss getting breakfast with friends, going to concerts, house parties, hearing about my friends traveling, walking in the big city, and even the simple act of sitting at a bench and just watching people go by. all of these little routines i miss so much and i'm worried we'll forever view them is horrendously unsafe. sure, i can catch up with my friends on ZOOM, or see some of my favorite concerts through streaming, but it feels like a constant reminder of our situation rather than a welcome distraction. i (sadly) assume that it will take a long time before i can partake in any of these rituals again, and even longer (or maybe never) before they'll feel natural and ""safe.""

even a temporary loss has been absolutely devastating to me, but the thought of these being viewed in a negative enough light for them to evaporate and be seen as relics of the past is breaking me. i support the lockdowns obviously but i see so many folks on reddit and twitter almost celebrating the death of public spaces and rituals. it's gonna suck ass to see the pivot of our society towards increasingly technocratic rituals and surveillance under the guise of safety. even formerly mundane rituals like going to the grocery store feel extremely dangerous and anxiety-provoking. sure, in the short term not going out in public is safe, but will the trauma of this pandemic forever turn us into hermits and hypochondriacs?

i suppose these concerns seem kinda stupid when we look at previous pandemics. we still had sex and intimacy after the devastation of HIV/AIDS (especially within the context of my queer ancestors). people celebrated in the streets even during the time of the spanish flu. but the world has changed so much since then. SARS and MERS seemed quaint compared to our current pandemic, but they left permanent marks on the way we operate and go about society everyday, especially in the areas it hit the most. i see so many technocrats and venture capitalists and whatnot spouting opinions such as that we should no longer have festivals and gatherings in the name of ""public health."" while i support not having these in our current situation, it's extremely crucial that we don't forget about our rituals pre-COVID, nor do we let the disease define our existence in this moment.

it's gonna be hard not living with these routines even in the ""short term"" (which is gonna feel so much longer than it actually is, no matter how long it'll take). honestly as negligent as they are, i can't even blame people for still wanting to go to church or hold parties just because it feels unfathomable to suddenly lose the ability to engage in one of humanity's basic traditions. obviously i don't support it, but i get the urge to do so myself, given that the pandemic still feels like an abstract concept to me and so many others. even past the strict social distancing measures, i worry that the small simple social routines will forever go away, and we'll live in an increasingly ""falsely-social"" world.

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m worried that even if we remove the lockdowns, even after COVID stops being a constantly-consuming threat to our society, we&amp;#39;ll be too deeply traumatized to return to any sort of &amp;quot;normal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i consider myself an extroverted person, but i really miss getting breakfast with friends, going to concerts, house parties, hearing about my friends traveling, walking in the big city, and even the simple act of sitting at a bench and just watching people go by. all of these little routines i miss so much and i&amp;#39;m worried we&amp;#39;ll forever view them is horrendously unsafe. sure, i can catch up with my friends on ZOOM, or see some of my favorite concerts through streaming, but it feels like a constant reminder of our situation rather than a welcome distraction. i (sadly) assume that it will take a long time before i can partake in any of these rituals again, and even longer (or maybe never) before they&amp;#39;ll feel natural and &amp;quot;safe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even a temporary loss has been absolutely devastating to me, but the thought of these being viewed in a negative enough light for them to evaporate and be seen as relics of the past is breaking me. i support the lockdowns obviously but i see so many folks on reddit and twitter almost celebrating the death of public spaces and rituals. it&amp;#39;s gonna suck ass to see the pivot of our society towards increasingly technocratic rituals and surveillance under the guise of safety. even formerly mundane rituals like going to the grocery store feel extremely dangerous and anxiety-provoking. sure, in the short term not going out in public is safe, but will the trauma of this pandemic forever turn us into hermits and hypochondriacs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i suppose these concerns seem kinda stupid when we look at previous pandemics. we still had sex and intimacy after the devastation of HIV/AIDS (especially within the context of my queer ancestors). people celebrated in the streets even during the time of the spanish flu. but the world has changed so much since then. SARS and MERS seemed quaint compared to our current pandemic, but they left permanent marks on the way we operate and go about society everyday, especially in the areas it hit the most. i see so many technocrats and venture capitalists and whatnot spouting opinions such as that we should no longer have festivals and gatherings in the name of &amp;quot;public health.&amp;quot; while i support not having these in our current situation, it&amp;#39;s extremely crucial that we don&amp;#39;t forget about our rituals pre-COVID, nor do we let the disease define our existence in this moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s gonna be hard not living with these routines even in the &amp;quot;short term&amp;quot; (which is gonna feel so much longer than it actually is, no matter how long it&amp;#39;ll take). honestly as negligent as they are, i can&amp;#39;t even blame people for still wanting to go to church or hold parties just because it feels unfathomable to suddenly lose the ability to engage in one of humanity&amp;#39;s basic traditions. obviously i don&amp;#39;t support it, but i get the urge to do so myself, given that the pandemic still feels like an abstract concept to me and so many others. even past the strict social distancing measures, i worry that the small simple social routines will forever go away, and we&amp;#39;ll live in an increasingly &amp;quot;falsely-social&amp;quot; world. &lt;/p&gt;

[Tokyo man dies in fire at his eatery closed due to pandemic]

(The article says just ""fire"".Other Japanese article says he commited suicide.We don't know for sure.There is possibility of accident.,Asahi is very careful media.)

As I live in Tokyo,I have lots of restaurant around me.I don't know every place.I didn't know this restaurant,which was close to my former apartment,still close to my new apartment.(One station apart).

He ran Tonkatsu restaurant,which his grandfather-in law began.He seemed to have hope for re-opening.

Looking Japanese COVID-19 spreading,it's unlikely.Japan extended state of emergency.Local restaurants are not getting help.This man,same age to me,died.or committed suicide.

He was my neighbor business.I could do nothing.His restaurant's homepage which I saw only screen shot was carefully made,rice was chosen carefully to match Tomkatsu.He was proud restaurant owner.

I cannot order every meal from local business as I'm on fixed income.I'm surrounded by business in danger.(Who are not on ""fixed""income)I feel really really powerless while a man same age to me died,or choose to die.

I decide to order a meal from local Nepal restaurant.I cannot do every day,of course though.

I hope this is the appropriate place to post this. Please let me know if otherwise.

My wife and I are living in the UK, and had a holiday to Switzerland booked for this June (June 1st - June 14th, booked over the space of Oct, Nov, and Dec last year) with several stays booked with Airbnb (amongst others, such as Booking.com).

Following the government advice to not travel unless absolutely necessary, we have been able to get a full refund for our Booking.com reservations, and some of our Airbnb reservations, however Airbnb are asking us for a government announcement ""telling"" citizens not to travel (not ""advising"") for a refund on the remaining bookings.

We've sent them the following link [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus), which they have rejected, saying that it is ""more travel advice"", however it clearly states ""Do not travel abroad unless it’s essential"".

,COVID19_support,"I suffer from pretty bad health anxiety. This pandemic is proving to be a living nightmare for me. In early April, my digestion got all weird. I automatically began to fear I’d contracted the virus. Then I passed my neighbor outside who I had heard coughing for weeks and that sent me into a full spiral. I’ve been feeling like hell ever since that day. Tight chest, digestion problems worsened, living in constant panic. 

I finally made a video appointment with my doc because I couldn’t handle the anxiety anymore. She prescribed me new medicine and that seems to have helped me calm a little, but the thoughts are still there. She also assured me that my physical symptoms are anxiety induced... I hope she’s right. I still feel bad.

That's included pretty much staying indoors since early March, avoiding grocery stores (doing curbside pickup only) and generally being hermits.  We don't even go out for walks or to our favorite parks and trails, as there are too many people and I've read some pretty compelling studies on how the virus can be transmitted even outside.

I totally FREAKED OUT when my wife mentioned this ""gathering"".  I told her that if I wanted to take that much risk that I'd much rather go to a park or our favorite trail.  Getting together with 20-30 other people A) isn't even ""allowed"" now in our state per our Governor's executive orders, but B) more importantly, is freaking dangerous.  

We talked about it and decided to politely decline going.  But - I also don't want us to be the couple that everyone thinks is nuts and laughs at behind our backs either..plus, I can tell wife is a bit disappointed that I didn't even want to CONSIDER going.

I've always been an introvert and social gatherings have always created anxiety for me..but now I feel like I'm voluntarily making us ""those people"" who were ""afraid"" of the virus.  (Yeah, I don't want either of us to wind up in the hospital, or worse..so maybe I AM ""afraid"" of it..)

Part of my problem is that I've read way too much about this since it all started..and probably know things about how this spreads that a lot of people aren't aware of.  So, they are probably thinking..""gee, what's the big deal?  None of us are sick.  It's just fine.."" (In all likelihood, the vast majority if not all of them are also probably totally clueless about asymptomatic transmission).

,COVID19_support,"Canadian here. I won't deny that my situation is more fortunate than most, I have a support network, I have some trickles of income coming in, and people I can fall back on- but damn if this situation isn't getting to me on a soul level.

&amp;#x200B;

After fighting a rotating combination of persistent depression, major depression, general anxiety for over a decade, losing six family members in recent years- including my sister and brother in law last year, and leaving a traumatizing relationship, I was finally clawing my way back to a good place. I was stable, happy, fitter mentally and physically than I had been in ages. I had nerved up in the fall to quit my dead end job to pursue something in my field after a repetitive stress injury had taken me out of the game. I live with two good friends, and have fallen in love with a wonderful man.

&amp;#x200B;

Queue 2020, and our *super awesome* global pandemic!

&amp;#x200B;

Hiring in my field has cratered. Most of my gigs have been back-burnered, or cancelled outright. I fall through every possible crack for CERB, as I've squeaked by with just over $1000 income to my name for the past few months.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't seen my partner since the beginning of March. He is slated to return to school for a paramedic course in the fall along with the second wave and I am absolutely terrified for him. They start ambulance ride-alongs early in that program. I will always be cheering for him ... but horribly selfish as it is I wish somewhere between one to one hundred times a day that he would get deeply emotionally invested in the postal service or something instead. He is a far stronger person than I will ever be.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally my roommates would be my go-to, but with the strong possibility of them being out of work in the coming months, and all the other compounding stressors the anxiety in this apartment has been through the roof in an unhealthy way.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the straw that broke the camel's back- my grandfather took a bad turn at the beginning of the year, resulting in my single mom and I having to move him into long term care before the writing was on the wall about how bad this was going to get. He ended up deteriorating quickly, and passed of non-covid related reasons at the beginning of this week. I feel like we fucking killed him just by sending him there.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is alone, and beating herself up over it as she feels like she could have been a better advocate if she could have visited him. Of course I can't tell her how I honestly feel, though logically I know he was far beyond the kind of care we could have provided at home. I'm just glad she was able to see him one last time before he went. I live four hours away, and am looking at taking a calculated risk to be with her for a while, as I know she struggles mentally in the same way I do, but I think I may end up pouring from an empty cup.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like every single good I have been working towards has just been yanked out from under me, and there is no viable end in sight. The more the reality of this lasting not weeks- but months and years is crushing. Everything feels pointless, and worst of all I feel aimlessly angry so much of the time, which just isn't me.  I force myself to eat well, to exercise, to reach out to people, to comb through listings and cold contact places. To do all the things you're supposed to do, and none of it is helping.

&amp;#x200B;

I am tired and I am terrified of losing more people I love. I am terrified of losing this life I've managed to carve out for myself in a community I adore, though my guilt of moving far from home is stronger than ever. I am terrified if  I take an essential job to get by that it will absolutely destroy the scraps of my mental state- and if I don't, that I will burn through my savings and be forced to move back to rural Ontario where even fewer prospects remain. Even if I manage to get by, I can't afford to live alone if things go sideways with my roommates.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want things to end, but I really, really want bad things to stop happening.

I'm tired of barely getting by and barely holding it together and trying to keep it all in.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are so many other people out there suffering so much more right now, but it's just getting to be a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Before the inevitable arises- I am fortunate enough to have a counselor, though I haven't talked to her recently as I know she'll want me back on medication. I have a track record of winning the brutal and rare side effect lottery from the SSRI &amp; SNRIs I've tried in the past, but I'm thinking at this point it's an inevitability it happens again. It was something I was really fighting to avoid having to fall back on.

&amp;#x200B;

I just needed to vent, I guess. Even if it is kind of shouting into the void.

You're not helping CNN. Look I made myself clear early on and recently that I support the social distancing measures and I don't believe in the other extremist ala it's just the flu bro. 

There will be a second wave I don't doubt it but I wish people would understand nuances and stop comparing this to the Spanish Flu. Although some historians have disputed reasons why the Spanish Flu was deadly during the second wave some have theorized that because of the nature of the First World War. Those who had the mild strain stayed in the trenches while the more severely ill were sent to crowded trains to hospital ships and thus they spread the more deadly strain of Spanish Flu. 

Unless Covid19 mutates which yes it is mutating but that is natural for viruses and coronaviruses tend to mutate far slower and though while nothing is guaranteed, based on what I have been reading from r/covid19 it is very unlikely to mutate in the way that doomers are hoping. Again it could happen.

I'm so amazed that we have two narratives in this crisis, either the pessimistic, ""we're all dead the second wave will kill us"" vs the ""it's a hoax, muh 5G"".

,COVID19_support,"I know everyone is in the same situation. So I feel guilty. Actually in some ways I am better off and that makes me feel worse.

But, there are so many things that have changed in my life as a result of this pandemic and they hurt me and I just want to have a bit of vent. Firstly, I graduated this month. Which is exciting for anyone but I managed to graduate whilst working, two miscarriages, giving birth, divorce, raising a newborn by myself and being diagnosed with a chronic illness. Like, I deserved to walk. It was tough!

Not only that but my fiance and I have been long distance and it has been very difficult.. But we were finally at the end of the visa process and things were looking up. Just had the interview to go which would have been this month and now I don't even know if I will see him again this year. He is my rock. I was moving in July and we were getting married. My parents had everything booked to holiday in his country and come to the ceremony in October and that's all gone.

It is also scary because he is high risk. Renal failure and a few other things so if he gets it he could die. Yesterday I found out his idiotic brother who went out despite everything probably has it and he is just waiting for the test results. They live together and my anxiety is at an all time high. He is staying in a room in the basement away from my partner who is being careful but I am still scared.

Also I feel for my partner as he had just graduated and was looking for full time jobs when this hit. Now he has nothing and his insurance expires this month. Which he needs for his expensive kidney medication to live. He is waiting on his unemployment to process (as he got furloughed) and then apply for Medicare but it is so stressful.

So I feel guilty. Actually in some ways I am better off and that makes me feel worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there are so many things that have changed in my life as a result of this pandemic and they hurt me and I just want to have a bit of vent. Firstly, I graduated this month. Which is exciting for anyone but I managed to graduate whilst working, two miscarriages, giving birth, divorce, raising a newborn by myself and being diagnosed with a chronic illness. Like, I deserved to walk. It was tough!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that but my fiance and I have been long distance and it has been very difficult.. But we were finally at the end of the visa process and things were looking up. Just had the interview to go which would have been this month and now I don&amp;#39;t even know if I will see him again this year. He is my rock. I was moving in July and we were getting married. My parents had everything booked to holiday in his country and come to the ceremony in October and that&amp;#39;s all gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also scary because he is high risk. Renal failure and a few other things so if he gets it he could die. Yesterday I found out his idiotic brother who went out despite everything probably has it and he is just waiting for the test results. They live together and my anxiety is at an all time high. He is staying in a room in the basement away from my partner who is being careful but I am still scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I feel for my partner as he had just graduated and was looking for full time jobs when this hit. Now he has nothing and his insurance expires this month. Which he needs for his expensive kidney medication to live. He is waiting on his unemployment to process (as he got furloughed) and then apply for Medicare but it is so stressful. It feels like everything that can go wrong will go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this year go from graduation, moving, marriage, finding our career jobs and buying our first home to this?&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"It is a beautiful day in Florida. My birthday was the 27. I just turned 33. I still have a job. I have money for food and a stable roof over my head. I am lucky. It still doesn't stop me from crying right now.

But I guess, I am mourning the future I had planned in the next couple of years. 2020 wasn't great before COVID. I had a minor health scare, got into a minor car accident, my boyfriend and I broke up, and my mom became incredibly sick (now we think it was COVID but it was before it was ""officially in the US). 

I had just got back into the gym hardcore in November. I was starting to see results in January and had planned on getting my own house, dating again, and I wanted to travel (I lived abroad for a long time and travel is my biggest passion). Also, in February I got my dream job (I am supposed to be working now but felt so depressed that I had to vent). I finally had a good job, losing weight, had a few nibbles on some dating websites, and was so happy. I felt hopeful and now was able to save money and start planning my life.

Then COVID happened. I decided I couldn't buy a house because what happens if I cannot pay it because the economy? So, I moved back in with my mom because she owns her own place but also to help her financially as she lost her job to COVID. I have been going to a deserted trail to walk but it's not the same as the gym. My big thing is that I wanted to go back to dating. I'd eventually like a family and I feel my time is running out. I say that because my best friend sent an article to me saying most predict two years of this (which started me spiraling this afternoon). Then I looked at how long the Spanish influenza lasted and it was 2 years. So, it seems like a reasonable estimate.

2 years will put me at 35. 2 years just gone. It's so unfair. I graduated into the recession and worked crap jobs. It sucks to see another one just as everything was looking up. It sucks because how am I ever supposed to meet someone? I really want a family. I always have and it feels like COVID is stripping me of the opportunity. 

Also, I am constantly in fear because I have really bad lungs. My parents stupidly smoked before, during, and after I was born (my dad passed of lung cancer from smoking in 2008, my mom was smart enough to stop over 20 years ago and is in good health). Thus causing me to have smaller than average lungs. Every year, a cold will turn into bronchitis. One time, I got pneumonia and it almost killed me. I was only 21 and had to be in the ICU for 7 days. I never smoked! It wasn't even a choice and now I am more at risk because of stupid decisions I didn't even make for myself. It's like life was finally looking up and then this all happened. It's like either wait 2+ years or go out and you might kill yourself and your loved ones. I know of someone from my college who just passed. He was in his 30s and his mom passed right before him. I worry constantly for my mom who is 65+ and my aunt is the same. I have an immuno-compromised nephew as well. I get sick worrying about them and myself.

I am just sad today. I have anxiety and OCD, so it's just been super hard. I feel helpless because of everything our stupid president is doing, I feel helpless because everything is so uncertain, I feel helpless because my dumb lungs, I feel helpless and then I get angry and lash out. I am angrier than I have ever been and have such a short fuse now. That was never me. Like reading about the Michigan protestors made me want to punch a window. That's not me. I am going to counseling sessions but it only helps for about a week or two at most.

,COVID19_support,"I'm worried I might have to stop seeing my dad since he refuses to wear a mask. He's a die-hard republican and Trump supporter, and has far different political beliefs than I do, but we still love and respect each other. He's been lamenting how the American government has been handling this outbreak. In his words, he says that Trump ""did the right thing but got the rug pulled out from under him by so-called scientists"", whatever that means. He sees this quarantine as the government's chance to take freedoms away from hard-working Americans.

He tells me over the phone today that starting tomorrow in California, people won't be allowed in stores without their masks (not sure if this is correct, I'm wearing my mask out in public anyways).

Where does he get his information, you ask? He doesn't trust major news outlets (even Fox to a fault), I think he gets most of his news through different sources online, and through the radio. He drives a lot and I know he's a fan of Mark Levin.

Recently he emailed me a link to a video that supported some of his opinions on Covid-19. It's not hosted on youtube, apparently it got 5 million views before it was removed from the site. I don't know if I'm allowed to post links to information that may or may not be true, but if you're curious, do a search for ""Accelerated Urgent Care doctors recommend lifting shelter-in-place order"", in quotations. You can also search for the doctor's names, Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi, for more information. It's an hour long and I haven't watched the whole thing, but I'm curious to hear what you guys think of information like this, scientifically accurate or not. I'm immediately skeptical of stuff like this, as I imagine most of you are as well.

I'm 28 years old and share a house with two 70-year olds who own it, I pay rent. My dad is a 70 -year old who lives somewhere else in town. He tells me he's taking precautions to not get sick, but if he's refusing his mask I don't know how true that is. He told me that if he can't go shopping without a mask on, he'd pay me to shop for him. However, I don't have a car, so he'd have to pick me up in person in order to do this, which I don't feel comfortable with. He came to America when he was 20, his feelings towards America at this point are complex to say the least.

The absolute worst-case scenario here is this: I meet with my dad at some point, maybe just to get lunch with him or something. He has coronavirus, doesn't know he has it, passes it on to me even though I'm wearing a mask. Then I go home and pass it on to my housemates by accident. If this happens, there's a high chance my dad dies, my housemates die, and a small chance that I die. Even if nobody dies, there's still a chance this disease causes problems later down the line years later.

I don't know what to do. I think I have to stop seeing my dad. Before the lockdown became a big deal, he was seeing me every week or so. I don't want to have to stop seeing my dad for a full year if not longer, especially if he catches this disease and dies from it.

I used to love grocery shopping. It was my mundane form of stress relief because I love food, planning meals, and being in grocery stores in general.

,COVID19_support,"So this is somewhat a relationship question, but I am curious if anyone here is experiencing the same thing.

For a bit of background my SO and I were duscussing the possibility of marriage back in February (we’ve been dating for almost 3 years) and I was feeling pretty good about our relationship at that point. We do not live together so when the shut down started I was feeling extremely anxious, worrying “What happens if one of us gets sick and we never get to see each other again?” I was also determined to isolate no matter what.

Making it worse was the fact that my SO was not taking it seriously in the beginning and he was continuing to go to work and go to the store as usual, even acting hurt that I would not see him when I was only avoiding him to keep him safe. Eventually I reached a breaking point where I thought “You know what, he won’t listen to me no matter what I say. If he gets sick that’s on him and I just have to let it go.” I started to feel a bit numb emotionally.

Then I went through a phase where I felt used to “the new normal”, stopped feeling so anxious about the virus, decided to be less strict about no contact and going for an outdoor walk once a week with my SO. Basically I stopped giving a fuck to some extent.

Currently we’ve been discussing the possibility of having physical contact in May some time, so long as we are both feeling well and have both been adhering to social distancing as best we can. Meanwhile I have suddenly reached a phase where I have no interest in my SO whatsoever and am feeling a bit repulsed by him or something. So basically I’ve gone from being terrified of losing him to indifferent, to suddenly and inexplicably losing feelings for him all together. 

It’s probably worth noting that I suffer from anxiety and depression and I have had doubts about our relationship in the past, but I was very happy with our relationship before all this started.

,COVID19_support,"So, first of all a context: I sadly am a binge eater and someone who eats trash food when extremely bored or stressed. And you would say ""is normal in times like these"", but in my case I am overweight.

In September 2019, when I joined my 3D art school, I hoped that I would move a lot and see more people, seeing that I had to commute from my city to Milan, which is at least one and a half hours away and I would develop friendships along the way. For once in my life, things looked like were going my way, with my shithead of an uncle being criminally prosecuted because he violated workforce laws and me becoming (until recently) the head coordinator of a small game I was making.

But coronavirus just ruined it all.

That bloody virus made me more stressed than ever, considering my mother works in the main City Hospital and talked about the virus ever since the first reports came out, and said that it would become a pandemic. I hoped she was wrong about that.

Ever since that, my life has been waking up, eat, school, eat, work, eat, play, eat, and going to bed, and it is ruining my whole life. My whole health. My whole everything. It is like that the moment the quarantine will be lifted and the vaccine or treatment will be found I will suffer even more from any sickness developed by this situation because of stress eating, and I don't know how and what to do.

I miss my girlfriend too, who lives in Czechia and is kinda lucky to live there right now and I don't know when I will see her given the borders are closed. I don't even mind not going to an airplane, I would just hop on my car to visit her, but this situation is getting me stressed. I cannot even follow e-classes because of this stress and I loved attending school. But this situation is making me worried I wasted money and won't pass at all.

How can I stop eating, and lose weight, when I am getting this stressed to the point where I MUST eat something sweet to just feel better? How can I cope with the fact that I don't know what to do? What am I supposed to do now, to feel less scared because of my weight?",t2_wn86y,False,,0,False,Covid-19 is ruining my life. And is not the virus itself ruining it.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support'}]",r/COVID19_support,False,,Support,0,,False,t3_gbdmlz,False,light,0.94,,restricted,14,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Support,False,14,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588346456.0,richtext,,,,text,self.COVID19_support,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, first of all a context: I sadly am a binge eater and someone who eats trash food when extremely bored or stressed. And you would say &amp;quot;is normal in times like these&amp;quot;, but in my case I am overweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2019, when I joined my 3D art school, I hoped that I would move a lot and see more people, seeing that I had to commute from my city to Milan, which is at least one and a half hours away and I would develop friendships along the way. For once in my life, things looked like were going my way, with my shithead of an uncle being criminally prosecuted because he violated workforce laws and me becoming (until recently) the head coordinator of a small game I was making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But coronavirus just ruined it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That bloody virus made me more stressed than ever, considering my mother works in the main City Hospital and talked about the virus ever since the first reports came out, and said that it would become a pandemic. I hoped she was wrong about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since that, my life has been waking up, eat, school, eat, work, eat, play, eat, and going to bed, and it is ruining my whole life. My whole health. My whole everything. It is like that the moment the quarantine will be lifted and the vaccine or treatment will be found I will suffer even more from any sickness developed by this situation because of stress eating, and I don&amp;#39;t know how and what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss my girlfriend too, who lives in Czechia and is kinda lucky to live there right now and I don&amp;#39;t know when I will see her given the borders are closed. I don&amp;#39;t even mind not going to an airplane, I would just hop on my car to visit her, but this situation is getting me stressed. I cannot even follow e-classes because of this stress and I loved attending school. But this situation is making me worried I wasted money and won&amp;#39;t pass at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I stop eating, and lose weight, when I am getting this stressed to the point where I MUST eat something sweet to just feel better? How can I cope with the fact that I don&amp;#39;t know what to do? What am I supposed to do now, to feel less scared because of my weight?&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"Hi /r/covid19_support,

Hope you're as well as can be given these unprecedented times.

I'm a 29 year old, currently living at home in the UK with my aunt, 2x female cousins and 1x male cousin. One of the female cousins has been working with Covid-19 patients at her hospital, came down with aches and a worsened cough yesterday (she's asthmatic), and has rang in sick and will be isolated for 2 weeks or so. Her test results came back just now and she's tested positive. She's 31 and is in reasonably good health, but anything can happen.

My situation is that I work as a designer for a global poker company. I've been put on furlough until the end of May, and then our company will 'see what happens'. I'm already concerned about this, as despite having savings and living with family, this is my career at stake and I'm meant to be moving in with a partner on July 1st. I continuously overthink this and it's playing on my mind over everything else. My partner works for the NHS and will be called back in June early as a midwife and said she'd support me no matter what, but her role will be strenuous enough as it is, I don't want to feel like a burden.

I'm trying to think of this from a practical standpoint, and each morning I take a dis-solvable vitamin C tablet in water, along with a vitamin D and vitamin B tablet. I've been staying on top of sleep, doing body weight workouts daily and drinking a **lot** of water. I've also been trying to stay distracted/busy by both consuming and creating content.

I feel super anxious now though because I followed the news quite closely when this all erupted originally. It's overwhelming to think of something I once followed on Reddit in Wuhan in January is now in my home :(

So, is there anything you'd recommend now that it's in the same building? Like anything I can do mentally to avoid spiraling? It'll be easier said than done but anything would be appreciated, honestly :( I'm a 29 year old in good health (no underlying conditions I'm aware of, had anxious/depressive episodes in the past but that's it for the moment)",t2_5u4fafl,False,,0,False,"Relative has now brought Covid-19 into the house, worries are at an all-time high",[],r/COVID19_support,False,,,0,,False,t3_gb0zjj,False,dark,1.0,,restricted,11,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,11,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588299184.0,text,,,,text,self.COVID19_support,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=""/r/covid19_support""&gt;/r/covid19_support&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"So I think I posted a couple days ago on this (so sorry for the duplication) but my anxiety isn’t subsiding and I just need to get through  at least today. This is long - sorry! 

TL;DR: I’m in my sixth week of covid symptoms, my anxiety about my parents led me to drop off a package for them (after taking precautions), but I’m freaking out thinking I made them sick. 

———-
So My main source of anxiety has been my parents getting sick (they are both high risk). I haven’t been able to go to them or do anything for them because I’ve had covid symptoms for the last six weeks. At the advice of my therapist, I talk/Skype with them everyday to make sure they are ok, which is reassuring but I also flip out at any slight signs of anything (my mom coughs, my dad said he was really tired, etc.)

For Easter, while I stayed home my parents let my brother in their apartment after he showed signs of sinus congestion and a cough a couple weeks before. I convinced myself he gave them covid and started flipping out. 

My brain decided that my parents needed to monitor their symptoms (they don’t have a thermometer or pulse ox) so I put on a mask and gloves, cleaned my thermometer and pulse ox with bleach, put them in a paper sandwich bag, and dropped them off on my parents doorstep. Afterward I got home, I called my mother to let her know I had dropped them off, but started freaking out and told her not to get the package until the next day. I told her I would call her when I was ready for her to get the package, but when I called the next afternoon, she had already brought it inside their apartment And left it on a chair in their living room. She said she washed her hands as soon as she brought the package inside, but she told me the night before she was going to use gloves. I told her not to touch it again, and they didn’t for 2 days just to be sure the virus would be gone. 

I’m really really scared that my anxiety of having my parents get infected will end up actually getting them sick. I’m terrified the paper bag picked up a ton of viral load in my apartment before I took it out, and it was cold the night I dropped the package off and kept the virus on the package. I’m worried somehow the virus got dispersed in my parents living room and made them sick. 

I know that covid lives on cardboard for 24 hours, and read that it can live less on more porous surfaces like tissue paper (the bag I used was very thin paper). And since then I had a negative covid test and my PCP said the most likely scenario is I had covid but am no longer infectious. But I really just need someone to tell me I didn’t hurt my parents.

This is long - sorry! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I’m in my sixth week of covid symptoms, my anxiety about my parents led me to drop off a package for them (after taking precautions), but I’m freaking out thinking I made them sick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;———-
So My main source of anxiety has been my parents getting sick (they are both high risk). I haven’t been able to go to them or do anything for them because I’ve had covid symptoms for the last six weeks. At the advice of my therapist, I talk/Skype with them everyday to make sure they are ok, which is reassuring but I also flip out at any slight signs of anything (my mom coughs, my dad said he was really tired, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Easter, while I stayed home my parents let my brother in their apartment after he showed signs of sinus congestion and a cough a couple weeks before. I convinced myself he gave them covid and started flipping out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brain decided that my parents needed to monitor their symptoms (they don’t have a thermometer or pulse ox) so I put on a mask and gloves, cleaned my thermometer and pulse ox with bleach, put them in a paper sandwich bag, and dropped them off on my parents doorstep. Afterward I got home, I called my mother to let her know I had dropped them off, but started freaking out and told her not to get the package until the next day. I told her I would call her when I was ready for her to get the package, but when I called the next afternoon, she had already brought it inside their apartment And left it on a chair in their living room. She said she washed her hands as soon as she brought the package inside, but she told me the night before she was going to use gloves. I told her not to touch it again, and they didn’t for 2 days just to be sure the virus would be gone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really really scared that my anxiety of having my parents get infected will end up actually getting them sick. I’m terrified the paper bag picked up a ton of viral load in my apartment before I took it out, and it was cold the night I dropped the package off and kept the virus on the package.

,COVID19_support,"Today a guy that delivered supplies to his place of work asked his age, then said, ""You know you're not supposed to be working right now, right?"" and all my Dad could say was, ""Yep.""

I'm so furious at his bosses. It's a small business. My Dad is the only employee. It's a glass shop, so they count as essential. The bosses were going to shut down, but after laying my Dad off decided to keep it open. They supposedly adore him and said he'd get his job back immediately when it was safe.

One of the bosses called my Dad last week and asked if he was comfortable coming back. My Dad admitted he wasn't, and she accepted it. Two days later she called him again and said she wanted him to come in the next day. 

So now my Dad, who sucks at following all of the safety guidelines and is high risk with COPD is going out into this crap every day. If I could trust him to wear his mask all the time and to not touch his face and to wipe everything down it wouldn't be so scary. But he just doesn't remember to even though he's also worried about getting covid.

I'm so pissed about this. He really shouldn't be working, but he's worried that by refusing to come back to work, he'll lose his job. They'll just replace him, and they might keep the new person permanently instead of him. 

My Dad was unemployed from Dec. 2017 to Jan of 2019. It's a miracle he got this job, because no one would hire him due to his age and previous pay. He and Mom had to move in with me and my ex husband. Then I had to leave my ex husband because he became very abusive and mentally unstable. We were homeless for over a month. We miraculously, at the last second, were able to get a new home thanks to my small divorce settlement for a down payment and Dad's job, and we love it here so much. It's perfect for us and cheaper than an apartment. So job security is extremely important to my Dad now. None of us want to be homeless ever again.

But the screwed up part is that if he were to get covid and die from it my Mom and I would still end up homeless, and we'd have lost him as well. 

It's lose/lose. I wish so desperately that there was a safety net, or a backup plan available. Lost your job due to covid, either because you were laid off or high risk? No problem, here's unemployment + $600 a week (which was more than he earns working and provided us with food security which we've now lost!) Still can't find a job due to your age? No problem, here's more unemployment. It won't run out until you get an adequate job because we understand you're old and no one wants to hire you.

But it doesn't work that way, and it's terrible. I'm just so scared for him.

Not to mention that this virus is amplifying my OCD dramatically. I wash my hands constantly, and every time I go to touch something, I'm afraid it's contaminated. But I've lost the will and energy to be as diligent as I was.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years back I decided to prepare for going abroad to study. There were many reasons why I decided that but here are the few which were most crucial in influencing my decision:

1. I don't like my parents - No, they don't beat me up and abuse me but I can't stand their arguments that my life should be devoted to them. No private sphere, no relationship. All their arguments depict clearly how close minded they are and in front of others they always portray how much freedom they have given me. Which to be does not exist!! Total hypocrites.
2. My girlfriend - My girlfriend lives in a country I want to go for higher studies.
3. Better education - If I say that education is shittier in my country, that would be an understatement. It's worse. All we are taught or rather ""expected"" would be the fitting word here, is to clear entrance exams for colleges and there again, not much development happens, than merely cramming the things and vomit those out in exams. Professors are happier with you only if you score good marks or help them write their research papers. Every doubt infuriates them more than anything.
4. Culture - I don't like the culture of my country at all. So narrow minded people, sky-rocketing illiteracy, political scenario is total mind-fuck (in a negative way), no such improvement in research and development domain, job market is shittier. All expected from graduates is to fill excel shits, despite their background, be it engineering or any other. Too much population, which drives more competition, be it college or job. And literally no one gives a fuck on what you think. ""We are more experienced, so don't bother teaching us anything"" is how many people react when you tell them that something is not right. Every damn thing is somehow a religious propaganda or a product of castesim. Mental issues like depression and anxiety does not exist in books of people. If you are depressive than most probably you are faking it just to grab enough attention or trying to manipulate people to give in to your requests.

After so many years of being in Long-distance relationship and trying to find ways to study there, I finally got opportunity this year to set my feet away from my home-ground. But then this corona crises showed up. Luckily I got enrolled in my University but again, they decided it would be better to start online-classes because studies of students should not suffer amid pandemic. I really appreciate this initiative but I am struggling to cope up with it. Reasons which I have found are: a. Time difference, b. Language (because I am studying in foreign language. I am fluent in it, but technical terms are somehow a challenge right now. Also, I have not been in that atmosphere so I am not used to it.) c. Family (similar reasons. Also they aren't supportive of me going there because apparently a priest said I can't leave my country at the moment).

&amp;#x200B;

Where am in all this?

&amp;#x200B;

I have discussed it with so many that I am pissed off that I can't travel right now. To me it appears that gradually the duration of my studies is decreasing and by the time I will reach there, I will be asked to appear for exams and just like that one semester will be over. I have no real contacts in class at the moment with whom I could discuss different things and so far I have realized it is expected from graduate students to be on their own. Slowly things are running away from my control and I am unable to do anything other than being depressive. I can't get up early, can't concentrate for longer. I haven't left my house since 11th March. When I decide to go for walk either my family is against or they offer a comprise that they will accompany me just so I would not come in contact with any infected person. Doesn't make sense to me. Like I am trying so hard to get away from you and you are not letting me? Every discussion we have comes down to convince me that my country is doing so much better, which apparently isn't the case. Only because there are not much numbers like Germany, US, Italy doesn't mean we are free from this pandemie. They always say ""you want to go for higher studies and now you are getting the chance to study. So don't be a pussy and focus on your studies."" Like that wasn't my sole purpose. I talked this out with my other friends and everyone says simply accept your situation and stop whining. It's not gonna change anything. Which I do understand. But what should I do? I am lagging behind in catching up with my studies. My mental and physical health is not in the best form lately. I am trying to stay away from my family and have closed myself in my room because they are getting on my nerves. Already tried to mold new habits but my pessimistic nature isn't allowing me to be consistent. All I think is to jump from my floor so that I could just be free. I feel so trapped, first by my family and now by everyone. And I don't see a solution coming in next 30 days.

So narrow minded people, sky-rocketing illiteracy, political scenario is total mind-fuck (in a negative way), no such improvement in research and development domain, job market is shittier. All expected from graduates is to fill excel shits, despite their background, be it engineering or any other. Too much population, which drives more competition, be it college or job. And literally no one gives a fuck on what you think. &amp;quot;We are more experienced, so don&amp;#39;t bother teaching us anything&amp;quot; is how many people react when you tell them that something is not right. Every damn thing is somehow a religious propaganda or a product of castesim. Mental issues like depression and anxiety does not exist in books of people. If you are depressive than most probably you are faking it just to grab enough attention or trying to manipulate people to give in to your requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After so many years of being in Long-distance relationship and trying to find ways to study there, I finally got opportunity this year to set my feet away from my home-ground. But then this corona crises showed up. Luckily I got enrolled in my University but again, they decided it would be better to start online-classes because studies of students should not suffer amid pandemic. I really appreciate this initiative but I am struggling to cope up with it. Reasons which I have found are: a. Time difference, b. Language (because I am studying in foreign language. I am fluent in it, but technical terms are somehow a challenge right now. Also, I have not been in that atmosphere so I am not used to it.) c. Family (similar reasons. Also they aren&amp;#39;t supportive of me going there because apparently a priest said I can&amp;#39;t leave my country at the moment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where am in all this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have discussed it with so many that I am pissed off that I can&amp;#39;t travel right now. To me it appears that gradually the duration of my studies is decreasing and by the time I will reach there, I will be asked to appear for exams and just like that one semester will be over. I have no real contacts in class at the moment with whom I could discuss different things and so far I have realized it is expected from graduate students to be on their own. Slowly things are running away from my control and I am unable to do anything other than being depressive. I can&amp;#39;t get up early, can&amp;#39;t concentrate for longer. I haven&amp;#39;t left my house since 11th March. When I decide to go for walk either my family is against or they offer a comprise that they will accompany me just so I would not come in contact with any infected person. Doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me. Like I am trying so hard to get away from you and you are not letting me? Every discussion we have comes down to convince me that my country is doing so much better, which apparently isn&amp;#39;t the case. Only because there are not much numbers like Germany, US, Italy doesn&amp;#39;t mean we are free from this pandemie. They always say &amp;quot;you want to go for higher studies and now you are getting the chance to study. So don&amp;#39;t be a pussy and focus on your studies.&amp;quot; Like that wasn&amp;#39;t my sole purpose. I talked this out with my other friends and everyone says simply accept your situation and stop whining. It&amp;#39;s not gonna change anything. Which I do understand. But what should I do? I am lagging behind in catching up with my studies. My mental and physical health is not in the best form lately. I am trying to stay away from my family and have closed myself in my room because they are getting on my nerves. Already tried to mold new habits but my pessimistic nature isn&amp;#39;t allowing me to be consistent. All I think is to jump from my floor so that I could just be free. I feel so trapped, first by my family and now by everyone. And I don&amp;#39;t see a solution coming in next 30 days. I don&amp;#39;t know how long I can handle it before losing my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

So there goes our two methods for defeating viruses, vaccines and herd immunity, out the window. If or when a vaccine comes out, I don't see any reason why it'd work any better than the seasonal flu vaccine, protecting you only temporarily from the one strain the vaccine was developed for. And then even if the actual virus eventually somehow gets beaten back, we'll all emerge into the worst economic depression since 1929 with a massively increased police and surveillance state justified because of the virus. The labour market was tough enough for me to enter before, now it's hard to realistically picture myself doing anything except collecting my welfare check to barely subsist upon.

,COVID19_support,"My elderly parents are divorced and I am supporting both financially. I feel I should count myself lucky for having steady employment in this pandemic, but I'm working on the other side of the world and cannot meet either due to travel restrictions. I am also super lucky and count my blessings every day because so long as I support them and do not attempt to contact my other relatives, they are willing to talk to me  again after cutting off ties when I came out many years ago. I am an only child so its the least I can do. They mean the whole world to me and it pains me to feel I need to talk it out when so many others are struggling harder.

My dad is seriously worrying me. He's been a sucker for get-rich-quick-schemes even before he retired and most of his 'friends' would turn out to be an MLM rep or similar when I eventually figured out who they were, selling him his own dreams. Like many people on the spectrum, he becomes completely enthralled by a topic or hobby and will research it endlessly online. Before he was on social media and when I was younger, it was collecting coins, stamps, shotglasses... but since getting on Facebook and Twitter he's gone completely down the political / conspiracy theorist rabbit hole and cannot be talked out of it.

I won't break the sub's rules by critiquing his beliefs or the articles he sends me dozens of times a day , every day, often very late at night; but they're in the realm of 'my-friend-on-Facebook-knows-a-US-special-forces-member-who-deployed-the-coronavirus-bioweapon-in-Wuhan-and-asked-me-to-forward-this', and 'inhaling-boiling-water-vapor-and-putting-sliced-onions-in-socks-cures-covid19' level of nuttery anyway. Before the pandemic he was an anti-vaxxer. He's also began raving about carrying out violence on people who oppose the groups he's following online - though I'm not terribly concerned because his health is so poor, he'd probably collapse trying to run towards anyone.

I've tried to debate him many, many times before, but he's from a very traditional background and considers himself the patriarch and will not entertain disagreement from someone younger than him.

I've tried to get him to drop the topic and claim that I'd rather not sour our relationship by bringing up politics anymore - and in fact never, ever start the conversation, but that prompts him to bombard me with more and angrier messages.

I've tried ignoring him. He'd stop for a few hours and then message me with links to cat videos and gardening how-tos. I'd respond positively, trying to encourage him, and he'll go straight back to the nuttery.

My daughter works at a small grocery store. She took a few weeks off because she had a lot of vacation time.

I just didn’t know where else to turn. Thanks for reading. 

This month, I found out that my promotion at work (to take place late summer) no longer exists due to COVID-19. Without this new position, I cannot afford to continue working for my current job.

After discussing this with my partner, we decided to find a silver lining, put an end to our long-distance relationship, and finally move in together. My current job is what had been preventing us from doing so before. Things happen for a reason, right?

I then applied and interviewed, in multiple stages, for a new job that felt like a wonderful fit. The interviewers seemed genuinely interested in me as a candidate, and they discussed specifics of salary, etc. with me in what seemed to be a final interview stage. Fast forward to Monday morning: a short email to say they’ve gone with a different candidate. To rub salt in the wound, I was multitasking at the time and read the email wrong. I mistakenly shouted “I GOT IT!” and embraced my partner, only to have him correct me. Oof. 

No worries, we thought. We continued working from home, and in the evenings, we’d sit down and watch HGTV/surf Pinterest for decor ideas for our future place. We found a great apartment right in our price/location and were early applicants to the landlord. With our high credit scores and combined income, we could easily afford the rent. On paper, everything was perfect.

Just as I was going off to bed tonight, my phone buzzed. An email from the landlord. 

She’d chosen a different couple to have the apartment. 

I know many people are feeling frightened these days, but I feel like everything I usually turn to for security (my hobbies, my home, my job...) is precariously held in the hands of others.

,COVID19_support,"I had to go to the emergency room for the first time in my life last night due to severe pelvic/abdominal pain. It was so bad I couldn't sit or lie down to sleep, and I knew if I didn't get help I'd be in trouble.

The waiting room was closed and I was alone other than the nurse behind the desk. I wore a mask and gloves, but had to take the gloves off when they took a urine sample.

I'm 23... not the *healthiest,* but things could be far worse, I suppose. I'm trying to get more sun exposure so I can up my vitamin D levels, because I'm pretty sure I'm deficient.

I'm feeling much better and my pain is mostly gone, so I feel kind of stupid having gone in. The wing I was in was basically totally empty and I was apparently one of two people who had been in that night at all.

(In the last 2 years that I’ve worked there, we were given annual cost-of-living increases). I’m not overly surprised, to be honest. I’m actually one of the luckier ones – some employees have been furloughed and others have been asked to take pay cuts.  

When I saw this email, I had a feeling of deja vu – I was only 3 years into my career when the Great Recession of 2008 hit. I was made redundant by my first employer, and although I managed to find a new job that I enjoyed, a company-wide pay freeze was imposed for about 5 of the 7 years that I worked there. Pay freezes of this type were fairly common for UK companies in the aftermath of the recession. 

I eventually moved on from that company as there were no opportunities to progress there, and that’s when I started my current job (about 3 years ago). By moving company, I had gone from junior level to mid-level, and I feel like I had made progress in the last 3 years. I was hoping to take a professional qualification this year (I had just finished studying for it a few weeks ago) and be promoted to senior level, but that won’t happen in 2020 now, as there won't be money in the company's budget. 

It's rather unfortunate as in many ways the UK never fully recovered from the 2008 recession. It feels like my generation is suffering a double whammy, experiencing 2 severe “once in a lifetime” economic crises in the space of little over a decade. In addition, my generation was the first in the UK that was required to pay university tuition fees and take on substantial debts. 

In addition to the constant fear of becoming seriously ill, it's disheartening that we may also be facing even more years of stagnation. I enjoy learning new things and improving my skills, but in some ways I also feel that it's not worth it if I will no longer be able to progress in my job. I keep having to tell myself that learning for learning's sake is also worthwhile, and that I can still feel a sense of achievement from doing online courses in my free time.

I cannot describe how much I love my son. I know it's cliche, but the minute he was born I knew he was the greatest gift I had ever received. His smile is so beautiful, he's so intelligent and developing so quickly. He lights up when he hears me sing to him. He is so handsome and I can't bear to think of a life in which I fail to protect him.


He has his 4 month appointment next week. It's considered essential. He'll be getting important vaccines, his weight and growth checks. I know it's the right thing to do.


But my God. I am terrified. I'll be spending the two weeks after watching him like a hawk, praying for his health and flinching at every cough and sneeze.


I booked the first appointment of the day. Everyone is required to wear a mask and wash their hands. I'm going to bring his swaddle and drape it over him in the waiting room. We'll be showering as soon as we get home...but even just typing this I am crying because I can't handle the thought of him being hurt or killed or growing up without a parent because of this fucking virus.

,COVID19_support,"You may have heard the news, the United States just passed one million cases yesterday. It may seem hopeless, especially when the news media keeps on spinning the most negative stories. But I recently checked back on worldometers and other statistic websites to see where we were, and let me just say, I've never been happier during this pandemic then now.

Bottom line, things are getting better, and the peak is near

Yes, yesterday the US passed one million cases, but also on that day, the US reported over 23,000 new cases. That may sound like a lot, but throughout this month, the mean has been between 30,000 and 35,000, sometimes spiking above on the worst days.

This is the lowest number of new cases since March.

And it's a very, very good sign. It might possibly be a lull, but with a decline this drastic, paired up with the high amounts of new cases we were seeing just a few days ago, likely coming from testing increases, and I have a feeling we may finally be starting to see the situation get better.

Moreover, people are recovering. And whilst the amount of people actually infected and have died might actually be higher, the amount of recoveries is also actually much higher than reported. This is because most cases are minor, and after they test positive for the virus, many don't go back once symptoms have cleared up. You can notice a discrepancy in some states. Most notably, some states, like Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina, have much lower active cases compared to their total, and this is not due to high death rates, but because they're reporting the recoveries. In fact, in Louisiana, there's more people that have recovered than who still have the virus. Considering how Louisiana has some of the highest and most accurate testing rates of any state in the country, chances are the rest of the US might actually be in this position. Once we DO start seeing those recoveries being reported, then you will see the US peak in active cases. And I have every reason to believe the peak for not just the US, but the pandemic as a whole, will be in just a few days. It may very well happen this week. I'm keeping my fingers crossed on that.

Not only that, but many countries have already passed their peak of the pandemic, especially in Europe. Spain, Italy, Turkey, Ireland, etc. have all reached their peaks. The worst is over for them. And this is increasingly happening to other countries too. There's other statistics that are reassuring. For example, we are having more recoveries now than we've ever had. On April 24th, even though that day reported more new cases than any other day of the pandemic, at a staggering over 100,000 people infected, it also reported the most recoveries, with over 68,000. Not only that, but the amount of people reported in critical condition is dropping too. It peaked at just under 58,700 on April 23rd. Now we have 56,300. That number should continue to drop over the course of the pandemic. Lastly, the reported outcomes of the pandemic. The fatality rate should be expected to be between 0.7 and 4%, according to scientists, but the outcome graph has looked different for a while, because with so many new infections, many of them started to die. The peak appeared to be on April 10th, when just 78% of people who had an outcome recovered. 22% died. Those figures are beginning to look much better. 81% recovered, 18-19% dead. We should see these figures continue to space out as this pandemic continues, but it does recede. I also want to remind you that deaths have long peaked. The highest number of the whole pandemic was on April 17th, when over 8,000 people died. Yesterday, just over 4,500 people died, which is significantly less. And as with new cases, April 26th saw just over 3,700 people die, again, the lowest since March. In the US, the peak of deaths was last week on April 21st, when a little under 2,700 people died. Yesterday, however, it was just under 1,400.

Not only is this lining up with the popular IHMO predictions, which states things should've gotten much better by now, but the situations seems to actually possibly be going BETTER in some cases compared to the projections. They predicted over 1,700 deaths yesterday in the US, but as previously mentioned, it was just under 1,400. For New York, the most badly affected state, they predicted that 325 people were going to die in New York yesterday, and whilst it was actually a little higher, considering the last reported death figure was 501 deaths on April 25th, it shows things are getting better as they predicted. And as for the UK, which they apparently have very bad predictions for, with over 1,200 people dying yesterday, it was actually just 360 according to Worldometers. Assuming trends continue, and all countries affected hit their peaks and then see declining active cases, we should reach a point close to when things started really going downhill in mid-March sometime in mid-June. By then, social distancing will likely have been greatly relaxed, most people who wanted a test will have gotten a test and the best-case scenario, treatment is available that will make the virus significantly less fatal.

And social distancing will eventually need to stop, not just for people's sanity. Even though he's been most wrong about the virus, Donald Trump has a point in saying that we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem. I remember watching a video about Ebola's impact on Africa, and they mentioned how the economic impacts of the virus might've actually killed more people than the virus itself. Chances are, this could very well happen, especially the longer we continue having the economy shut down. That's why I anticipate in the next few weeks, likely sometime in May, you will start seeing social distancing and lockdown policies be relaxed in most of the developed world, including the US. We can't do it now, and it likely won't happen this or even next week, but sometime in May, I anticipate you may start being able to actually talk to others and hang out again, if in a limited capacity. And they will get further relaxed over the course of the summer. Though some like Dr. Fauci claim of a second wave similar to the Spanish flu, we have to remember this ISN'T the flu, it's a coronavirus. A second wave might not happen, especially if we do this right. Remember, SARS, which COVID-19 is similar to, did not have a second wave, it just had THREE reported cases in 2004 and then that was the end of it. COVID-19 obviously isn't going to be like that, but whilst a second wave definitely shouldn't be a possibility to rule out, it may not even happen, so having plans for fall shouldn't automatically be dashed because of what you heard on the news. I'm saying this as China is starting to reopen everything and they haven't reported any sudden spikes of cases like some have feared. In fact, new cases and active cases is only further decreasing. Even if it were to decrease, they would now have the resources and knowledge to deal with it, and much like all of us, we wouldn't have to resort to lockdowns or stay-at-home orders to deal with it. With extensive testing, sanitation, and a prohibition on large gatherings (so you still may not see conventions and sports over the summer, but you could do most of your summer vacation stuff if you wanted to, granted, you may not be able to travel anywhere outside the country), we can have it to where life is effectively close to normal, whilst still having the virus in a manageable position. We're not going to be able to eradicate the virus this year, it's already infected way too many people, but we can make it much more manageable to where life can continue in a relatively normal capacity. It's been infecting tens of thousands of people this month every day across the world. If we can get those numbers down to the thousands or hundreds place, it'll be much easier to deal with, and life and the economy will be able to continue like normal.

Whilst everyone is trying to predict the future of the pandemic, we have to remember that ultimately, if you really think about it, viruses behave a lot like gases. My 7th grade biology teacher gave this analogy: someone farts in a room, nobody notices it at first, then it spreads, and they smell it, others begin noticing it too, until it covers the whole room, but then, over time as it is spreading across the room, it is dispersing, where as it spreads out, it covers less space, because the volume increases but the mass stays the same. Obviously, viruses kill, farts can't, so it's not exactly the same, but it works essentially the same, as you'll notice if you studied any other pandemic. It spreads across every country it can, infecting everyone in sight. When the virus runs out of hosts to infect, it burns out, it  disperses, and even much like the fart you let it, it no longer becomes noticeable to anyone. Even if it is still physically lurking around, others have become preoccupied with other things as other gases take the original gases prevalence. The same goes with this current pandemic. Eventually, less people become infected, it becomes more sporadic, people become more interested in other things beside the virus as fears lessen, and eventually, people move on. This will likely go down in the history books, but soon, this pandemic will become just that, history. Maybe a lesson for leaders to look to, to avoid the same mistakes. Maybe people will listen to science more and stop blindly putting their faith in incompetent politicians and the system.

The effects of the virus are going to linger well after the peak. People will still get infected, some businesses will stay closed, some places like Disney World will stay closed, sports may not be on for a while, and most notably, the economy. The worst year for Liberia during the Ebola epidemic was NOT in 2014 when it was at its worst, but rather 2016. It's entirely possible for some countries, 2020 will not be the worst year for the economy. In order to make sure these impacts are minimized, people and leaders and scientists must stay vigilant. For as long as the possibility of infection remains, scientists must keep researching, politicians must have their plans, our resources must be kept, for whatever comes next, we have to stay vigilant.

But ultimately for what comes next, things are going to get better. Life will likely re-open AT THE ABSOLUTE EARLIEST in mid-May, but it probably won't be until June. But the good news is the light at the end of the tunnel is beginning to shine, the possibility of normal life is gradually coming back to our hands, and all this will be over before you know it.

We may have passed 1,000,000 cases in the US, but if we do things right, we may not see the 2,000,000th.

Ultimately, what all of these statistics mean is that whilst April may sound like Wake Me Up When September Ends, everything is lining up for May to instead sound like Through The Fire and The Flames...

We&amp;#39;re not going to be able to eradicate the virus this year, it&amp;#39;s already infected way too many people, but we can make it much more manageable to where life can continue in a relatively normal capacity. It&amp;#39;s been infecting tens of thousands of people this month every day across the world. If we can get those numbers down to the thousands or hundreds place, it&amp;#39;ll be much easier to deal with, and life and the economy will be able to continue like normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst everyone is trying to predict the future of the pandemic, we have to remember that ultimately, if you really think about it, viruses behave a lot like gases. My 7th grade biology teacher gave this analogy: someone farts in a room, nobody notices it at first, then it spreads, and they smell it, others begin noticing it too, until it covers the whole room, but then, over time as it is spreading across the room, it is dispersing, where as it spreads out, it covers less space, because the volume increases but the mass stays the same. Obviously, viruses kill, farts can&amp;#39;t, so it&amp;#39;s not exactly the same, but it works essentially the same, as you&amp;#39;ll notice if you studied any other pandemic. It spreads across every country it can, infecting everyone in sight. When the virus runs out of hosts to infect, it burns out, it  disperses, and even much like the fart you let it, it no longer becomes noticeable to anyone. Even if it is still physically lurking around, others have become preoccupied with other things as other gases take the original gases prevalence. The same goes with this current pandemic. Eventually, less people become infected, it becomes more sporadic, people become more interested in other things beside the virus as fears lessen, and eventually, people move on. This will likely go down in the history books, but soon, this pandemic will become just that, history. Maybe a lesson for leaders to look to, to avoid the same mistakes. Maybe people will listen to science more and stop blindly putting their faith in incompetent politicians and the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of the virus are going to linger well after the peak. People will still get infected, some businesses will stay closed, some places like Disney World will stay closed, sports may not be on for a while, and most notably, the economy. The worst year for Liberia during the Ebola epidemic was NOT in 2014 when it was at its worst, but rather 2016. It&amp;#39;s entirely possible for some countries, 2020 will not be the worst year for the economy. In order to make sure these impacts are minimized, people and leaders and scientists must stay vigilant. For as long as the possibility of infection remains, scientists must keep researching, politicians must have their plans, our resources must be kept, for whatever comes next, we have to stay vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ultimately for what comes next, things are going to get better. Life will likely re-open AT THE ABSOLUTE EARLIEST in mid-May, but it probably won&amp;#39;t be until June. But the good news is the light at the end of the tunnel is beginning to shine, the possibility of normal life is gradually coming back to our hands, and all this will be over before you know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may have passed 1,000,000 cases in the US, but if we do things right, we may not see the 2,000,000th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what all of these statistics mean is that whilst April may sound like Wake Me Up When September Ends, everything is lining up for May to instead sound like Through The Fire and The Flames...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BECAUSE WE WILL CARRY ON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"I had OCD on and off for years now. This pandemic is killing me half to death with worrying about possible exposures. Here's what happened to me yesterday:

* I went to a Walmart to get a money order for my rent. I put on my surgical mask that I have been wearing only for walks around my apartment complex. When I was looking for rubbing alcohol I came across a woman in scrubs with a mask on. That was trigger #1.
* Trigger 2 came when I found out I was spending too much time inside (about 1hr 22 mins according to my Lyft ride logs). My reasoning was I was increasing my initial viral load. Of course I came at a time when people were cashing their stimulus checks and or doing other things in the MoneyCenter.
* Trigger 3 was when I was about to go in line at the MoneyCenter and found out that the left side of my mask was touching my left eyelid. I thought I have got it because perhaps someone's aerosoled spit or exhaled RNA reached the near top of my mask.
* Trigger 4 came when I got some food and some of it dropped to the floor two times. I thought I got it through the virus tracking on someone's shoes.
* Triggers 5 and 6 came after a fast food run with a neighbor and during a quick bedtime walk. Someone was smoking marijuana near me - I can literally smell it as I passed. I immediately thought the virus in the marijuana smoke infected me. As I was approaching home a person living in the unit next to me was shaking a comforter. I thought someone was sick inside and the virus was being expelled into the air when there was a variable wind. with my shirt way up my nose and mouth i briskly walked by to my unit and closed and locked the door quickly.

Yep, my OCD is outta control. I have always said that the worry of catching it will kill my fat ass fasted than the virus will. I need some help to cope.

,COVID19_support,"Hi, all, 

My apologies for this post that will inevitably turn into a vent. 

I ordered a keyboard that shipped from China. It shipped in a cardboard box on April 21 and arrived an hour ago. When it arrived, I accepted it, and immediately wiped it down with a Lysol wipe. My roommate told me I had to leave it for three days before opening it, but I proceeded to open it. She then became hysterical and insisted I was trying to kill her and did not care about the health and safety of anyone. 

Here is my thought process: 

COVID-19 can live on plastic for up to 72 hours, and it can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours. If one assumes (reasonably) the cardboard box was never opened since it shipped one week ago, if the plastic was infected with COVID-19 immediately before it was shipped, it is impossible for it to be still contaminated. And, I think it is even less likely contaminated because the likelihood it was freshly manufactured before shipping is null. More likely it was sitting in a warehouse, but I digress. As for the cardboard, yes, it is possible it is contaminated, but the Lysol wipes would have destroyed it. In short, I see the risk non-existent. 

I am frustrated with this COVID-19 situation, and I do take it seriously, but at the same time, I do not feel as if I have been reckless. 

Again, my apologies for the vent. Any feedback would be appreciated.

This has sent me into such a weird anxiety spiral- and I was FINALLY starting to be able to control my anxiety after weeks of it going off the mother-effing rails.

I don't want to keep having the same conversation with her, because she's so stubborn and I'd rather not have tense conversations anymore.

,COVID19_support,"I own a small business in a small town in Texas. My business (food service) is considered essential under the guidelines, so I've been open all this time. It's a food trailer, so it's take-out by design. I take all the precautions: mask, gloves when serving curbside, I've closed our courtyard to customers, people have to wait for me to bring their food to them contactlessly, no cash, on and on.

As it's been with all other restaurants, I've taken a hit in sales. It's been rough, ngl, and I want this all to be over as soon as possible. But we can't fucking do that when people are roaming around as if it the world was the way it was before all this shit started.

I feel like Texas has been under a blanket of false security. Our case counts have been relatively low, especially for our population. Some of this is due to early action that cities like Dallas and Austin took, but Houston -- as far as I know -- was late to the game. We're at the very bottom in terms of testing. For the longest time, there was no testing in my county, and then there was testing for those who were ill enough to be admitted into the hospital. And just recently, we got a mobile testing unit from the Texas National Guard, but you still have to get screened. One other independent testing site has been set up, but it's only a couple of days out of the week for a short period of time, has limited hours and your doctor has to make the appointment for you.

So almost no one, in the grand scheme of things, has been tested. But the government is running around saying how well we're doing. I am almost positive those who have the coronavirus, but aren't being allowed to be tested, are just being sent home, so we have no clue how many people could be hospitalized but aren't being. And none of this is getting reported in the media. A study from UT was just released saying that we've hit our peak, but, again, without a proper testing regime I don't know how you can make that assumption.

And it's on all of these bases that the state is deciding to reopen. We had the dumbass protesters in Austin. There are restaurants in the state which are re-opening for dine-in service on their patios, which is infuriating. Ever since the beginning of this thing, people haven't really been taking the shelter-in-place orders seriously.

I feel like I'm going fucking crazy. Our data does not match the data for other states in a similar situation.

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t want to ruin her birthday and police the gifts people send her but, cupcakes or cakes coming from the heart of the pandemic in the US is freaking me out. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

My thoughts have been super negative about coronavirus I’m worried about losing everything and I feel so badly for the kids and adults that are going hungry because of the high unemployment and I’m worried about the kids in unsafe homes who have nowhere to go. I personally feel all alone, in the course of three months I dropped out of nursing school and switched my major. I quit my job because it was unsafe. I won’t be able to have my wedding because of Coronavirus. I was supposed to celebrate my 21st birthday in May with my relatives in Virginia and I won’t be able to do that. Oh and my father almost died in a mass shooting the week before we went on quarantine. It’s been the worst months of my life and COVID is just fucking up my entire life.


I’m trying to find some hope so here’s my little hope I’m hanging onto 
1. Eventually this will be over 
2. Eventually kids will be able to go to school and won’t have to deal with their abuser 24/7
3. It’s turning out to have less of a mortality rate than scientists thought

1. People being dismissive about mental health through all this and making really ableist comments about wanting us to stay quarantined until there’s a vaccine.

Also people with injuries who haven’t been able to see the doctor because it’s non essential. I guess you’re damned if you do or damned if you don’t. 

2. I also hate people being so freaking rude to each other. At the grocery store the cashier had a gallon of milk thrown at her because he could only buy two jugs not three. People on the internet are rude, people in real life are rude. It makes me so sad. 

3. Protesters are pissing me off. They are doing literally nothing but getting themselves and others sick. They are literally ruining any progress my state made. I’m worried because of them I’ll never be able to leave this hell state I’m in. I don’t want my governor to open up yet but I’d like him to eventually and the protesters are horrible.

COVID took all of that away from me. The routine I needed to manage my symptoms, to give me a sense of normalcy, was taken away.

Is this advisable? Am I being completely reckless and irresponsible and putting others lives at risk? I am planning on trying to get a COVID test done before I leave. Supposedly there is an urgent care clinic around the corner from me that is doing them.

,COVID19_support,"About 4 weeks ago I was sleeping. I kept dosing off and waking back up. After several repeats of this I realized that I would stop breathing soon after I dozed off. I remember reading reports coming out of china that the body would forget how to breath with CV19. I would take deep, long breaths to relax myself, drift off, wake up fully, repeat. This happened enough that I started to feel like something was wrong. The thought of a possible CV19 infection kept playing over and over in the back of my mind. I got out of bed for a glass of water and a quick walk around the house. I tried again to sleep. It would work but I kept breathing faster. I felt like I **had** to force myself to breath or I would die. It didn't stop for an hour which was when I woke someone up to take me to the hospital where they injected me with something and within 30 minutes I was back to my ""normal"" self again. I was not tested for covid but being at the hospital made me more paranoid. 

Now, even several weeks later, the thought of going to sleep causes my throat to feel like its closing up. I cant fall asleep on my side or my stomach without feeling like Im being suffocated. Once Im out Im usually fine. If I have a carb crash/coma where I just pass out Im ""fine"" minus what ever harm a general carb crash does.

I kept dosing off and waking back up. After several repeats of this I realized that I would stop breathing soon after I dozed off. I remember reading reports coming out of china that the body would forget how to breath with CV19. I would take deep, long breaths to relax myself, drift off, wake up fully, repeat. This happened enough that I started to feel like something was wrong. The thought of a possible CV19 infection kept playing over and over in the back of my mind. I got out of bed for a glass of water and a quick walk around the house. I tried again to sleep. It would work but I kept breathing faster. I felt like I &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt; to force myself to breath or I would die. It didn&amp;#39;t stop for an hour which was when I woke someone up to take me to the hospital where they injected me with something and within 30 minutes I was back to my &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; self again. I was not tested for covid but being at the hospital made me more paranoid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, even several weeks later, the thought of going to sleep causes my throat to feel like its closing up. I cant fall asleep on my side or my stomach without feeling like Im being suffocated. Once Im out Im usually fine. If I have a carb crash/coma where I just pass out Im &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; minus what ever harm a general carb crash does. Im not eating as many carbs now because of that and thus not falling asleep in the middle of the day. When 11:30/midnight rolls around, then I start having problems breathing.

She's been in quarantine since then and I never got tested but got a slight start of a cold after she was in quarantine for a few days and then lost my taste and smell a week later. We're on the same floor and it had to stay that way bc my grandfather and everyone else has rooms downstairs. I regained my taste and smell as of now for 6 days maybe as did she, but I've noticed that it's a little bit harder for me to take deep breathes.

I’m on week 6, and I realized around week 2-3 when it was the worst for me that my anxiety spiked and caused triggering thoughts. It caused me severe depression when in isolation. Because of the illness, it caused me to be bossy, mean, and unstable which caused a huge strain on my relationship. I called him horrible names and had terrible mood swings for weeks. After a big fight, I moved in with my sister two weeks ago. This caused me to have a panic attack and impulsively bombard his phone with calls and texts which pushed him away even more. Now as of a week ago, my boyfriend isn’t talking to me. This has been so stressful for all of us and I feel I’ve ruined my relationship. My family is worried not only for my physical health, but mostly the mental effects this has caused. I’ve started virtual therapy and have my second session tomorrow. I’m feeling much better physically and mentally, although I’m still on the mend. Even though I’m seeking help and out of the darkness, I feel it’s caused permanent repercussions in my life.

,COVID19_support,"Well, right now i have a lot of encountering  feelings.
I'm mad because of the increasing  number of Covid-19 cases here at Mexico (today the number is up to 14677 confirmed cases,  including 1351 death's. And I have seen a lot of people  complaining on internet in both ways, some that is fake,  is a scheme to ""slave us"" and the government control us... but also people that complaints that the government is NOT testing enough, the numbers are faked to be ""too low"".

However, something else is added: it's clear that there is a political fight involved too. If the numbers are right, my home state, despite having the second or third most populous city in the whole nation, the numbers of confirmed and death  are pretty low, even compared to other less populous states (282 confirmed cases, 25 deaths here at Jalisco). God, we are even on the last 3 places on number of cases per 100,000 people,  that should be something to notice... but nope, Federal government is ignoring and still accusing that we are not doing enough...
Hell, here the state ordered to everyone use masks from the Monday in public places, there's a lot of problems since a lot of business are closed to help slow the disease,  I even had to go home with half salary since our workplace must have massive events to work, and we are ""offline"" since late March, following states orders an so.

What I'm angry,  is that we started to make sacrifices, a lot. Yes, a lot of people isn't helping,  even some idiots dare to assault healthcare workers. But also a lot is making everything possible so we can survive this. Dammit, even the local churches switched to make all the celebrations,  including holy week, via live streams on internet so people don't need to go physically to the temples. Schools started home education earlier than other places, massive events cancelled,  bars closed... the response  of our state was early,  even other states followed us and joined the efforts with the same actions... but the federal government still dismiss us, telling that we are doing wrong...

So I work with young children in-home. I haven’t been to work since March, but earlier, my job decided the return date would be later this week. I had agreed then to return this week thinking everything would start to blow over. I also got an email earlier today asking me to confirm if I’d be returning, and I said yes. But the more I think about it, the more scared I become. I have asthma, my mom has asthma and diabetes. So we’re both higher risk. Since I work with young kids, social distancing is not possible.

,COVID19_support,"Hi, y'all. Throwaway account here (if this is the incorrect subreddit, please let me know where I can post this).

TL;DR - My employer wants me to work in our office even though I'm not ""essential"" (unless it's via phone or email).

To give you a bit of context, I'm working a desk job.

So, I live in a country where it's lockdown and the government rules are it's required to work from home unless it's not possible. They will lift this rule a little soon (but you still have to work from home if you have a decent internet connection, which I do). The thing is, my employer wants me to come into office with a few other people to do my usual job, when I've been doing that shit from home this whole time (wasn't asked prior if this was okay with me). I have pushed the head of this particular office for formal safety documents to support this decision, but can't come up with any so now they're just being disrespectful to my emails while stalling for time to come up with what I'm asking for.

During this lockdown, I've been diligently at home unless I'm walking to the supermarket every few days to get some food. I hate that I'm having to break this for my employer (financial reasons).

I am trying to dispute this but frankly, it is taking so much of my time and it is so mentally and emotionally draining. This whole thing has made my depression worse. Why the fuck did I even try to speak up? Then I remember, someone has to.

I have tried a union, employment rights, escalated it internally, and will even escalate it to government. Some of their responses were generic, and I'm waiting for replies on some of them.

A small part of my brain (apologies, I only have a few brain cells left) wants to resign effective immediately (if only I had more savings), and either ask my landlords for a rent reduction, or just go the fuck home altogether (I live in a different city at the moment). 

Some advice/encouragement would be nice (that I tried to fight for what's right), or maybe even similar stories.

,COVID19_support,"My 7 y.o. niece and 6 y.o. nephew (from my older sister and older brother, respectively) are both going through severe anxiety over the pandemic. My nephew doesn’t want to leave the house at all anymore, and my niece is doubtful that school will ever be in a classroom again. 

I’m heartbroken that these young children are more pessimistic than most adults I know. They have been watching the news over their parents’ shoulders for the last few months and now have very firm beliefs about the situation. I’m worried for their long term mental health. 

I don’t have kids of my own. I live across the country from my whole family, so I unfortunately haven’t been around them very much over the years. They usually see me every six months or so. I live alone and just started playing Animal Crossing on the Switch Lite (since the regular Switch is sold out.) It’s brought me a lot of joy and been a wonderful outlet for simulating going out in nature. 

I figure if this game can help me stay distracted, it might do wonders for my niece and nephew as well. Unfortunately, my sister and brother aren’t making enough to afford the console+game. Tonight I ordered two switch lites to my house that I’ll set up and purchase the games on myself then ship the devices out to them. I’ll also include a note that says “I owe you: 100,000 bells”

My favorite part of the game is the satisfaction of paying off a home upgrade, incline or bridge. I’m going to have the kids work to pay me back for the consoles by giving me bells in the game. This will get them engaged in fishing, bug catching, gardening, and meeting daily goals. The paying me back aspect is just another in-game benchmark to give them a feeling of progress and accomplishment. I can also let them pay me in bells or items for other Nintendo games - I’ll just send their parents the codes after they’ve worked for the goal. 

Sorry for the long post. I just really wanted to share this with the community as an idea of how to help kids who are dealing with anxiety over the world right now. Some escapism and goal-oriented gameplay can be really good for the spirit. Hope you all stay well during this time.

,COVID19_support,"No human engagement for 8 hours a day, especially with the undercurrent of stress of the world seeming to fall apart, fear for yourself and loved ones, and job insecurities due to loss of customers, can really mess with someone. I think a meeting now and then, under any pretense (maybe just to outright shoot the breeze!), can help people stay centered when they are forced to stare at a screen for eight hours a day.

As a personal anecdote, I work in a small department. When I went onsite, we had bi-weekly meetings and had lots of work discussions with each other. Then suddenly I'm working from home. I live alone, so I have no one anymore to say hi and bye to. No one I'm passing in the hall, no co-worker I can wave to. The change for me was pretty abrupt.

To make it worst, we stopped having much reason to IM or talk at all since our tasks changed due to emergency issues by the company trying to survive. My leadership and one or two others were extremely busy, while the rest of us were somewhat left to fend for ourselves, begging other departments for work. Our reasons to meet as a team were on the back-burner and tons of meetings were cancelled or pushed out.

I've worked from home before, and after a couple years I started to lose it. This time it took me 25 days. It's hard to explain what happened to me, but I really do think I lost part of my mind. Not even sure I've recovered yet, or ever will. I wonder if being furloughed would have been easier, because at least then I could concentrate my time on processing my feelings, instead of the unhealthy processing I did while trying to work with people without any true interaction.

I don't really know how it has been for my co-workers, all of whom live with people. But I know everyone struggles to some degree from the pandemic. My manager and her manager finally decided we'd have a meeting, coming up next week, just to talk and re-connect. Everyone seems excited to finally interact. It will definitely help me, and also last week my manager gave me more tasks to occupy me with, which has helped tremendously. May be too late in some ways, but it all helps.

So if anyone has a similar situation where you and your colleagues are suddenly working at home, perhaps prioritize interactions even if it seems like there are more important issues and that time for those in leadership is a precious commodity. Yes, keeping the company afloat is a priority, but retaining your employees, and keeping them sane, is also a priority.

Already one co-worker is quitting for another job, though I don't know anything about his motivations. But I wouldn't be surprised if more, especially from another department I work with, will quit when able to find something else. And the reason in their cases would perhaps be the kind of madness the pandemic brings, warping everything, yet so easily held at bay by a friendly voice now and then.

Again, this is my experience and my thoughts. I'm curious what others have experienced in similar work situations?

,COVID19_support,"Hello -

On April 2nd my sister received a positive test and we immediately put her up in the master bedroom of our house (it has a en suite bathroom and access to the roof for sitting out in the sun). After she recovered and endured the self isolation until April 16th , my wife and I haven't even the opened the door since she left. We are sleeping on the floor of our living room. Not the end of the world, but our air mattress is terrible.

I have looked everywhere for reasonable advice about when the room is safe to enter (and ultimately sleep in) but given the lack of information on the virus, it's hard to come by. So I'm curious if you have quarantined a family member, and what you did to reopen the space they occupied.

&lt;p&gt;On April 2nd my sister received a positive test and we immediately put her up in the master bedroom of our house (it has a en suite bathroom and access to the roof for sitting out in the sun). After she recovered and endured the self isolation until April 16th , my wife and I haven&amp;#39;t even the opened the door since she left. We are sleeping on the floor of our living room. Not the end of the world, but our air mattress is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have looked everywhere for reasonable advice about when the room is safe to enter (and ultimately sleep in) but given the lack of information on the virus, it&amp;#39;s hard to come by. So I&amp;#39;m curious if you have quarantined a family member, and what you did to reopen the space they occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"Before anything Covid related was happening, September of 2019, I was kicked out of my University on my first infraction. I don't want to preface that story with any more detail, however, if you are interested Message me on here and I will be happy to share more about that. During the summer of 2019 after my first year, I took a class at a Junior College earning myself enough credits to be qualify as a sophomore. Getting kicked out caused me to move back in with my parents  before I was able to start my second year, and it has been terrible. I was  in a toxic environment living at home, which I come to realize now was because of our relationship.

When the news about Covid-2019 surfaced I wasn't worried, my store manager told me that the business is going down and to ask the supervisor about my last paycheck. I did and he told me ""We had to eliminate many hours off the schedule, even a little more possibly this week. However, at this point we have not eliminated any positions, as we hope this won't last too long and we will be able to extend hours again."" I then asked him what this meant for me, to which he responded. ""Honestly, I'm not really sure. At this point everything is just a guess as to when things will change."" Having not received helpful information I told him I appreciate the help. This was March 23rd, and I waited at home in the meantime for an update. I received a message from the same supervisor on April 8th asking how I was doing and asking if I would like to come back to work. Ecstatic I told him Yes, and the next day told me to come in on the 12th from 8am-12, but my coworker asked me to stay and close so I did, and I got out at 2:50pm. I then was scheduled the 16th, 18th, and the 19th. I showed up on time for all of those shifts.

During my first week back to work; I work as a cashier by the way; I was only given a face mask on the first day. Throughout the week it became evident that my employers were not tactful with providing what I consider necessary safety equipment to perform my job. On the 20th I was scheduled to come into work as well, so I woke up early to make myself breakfast and to contact the IRS about a letter informing me that someone stole my information. While on the phone, I received a text reminder about my phone therapy session I scheduled 2 and 1/2 weeks ago. This was around 8:38am while I'm scheduled to come in at 9, I texted my supervisor and told him my situation. I offered to come in after my therapy phone call and close the store for him, and he told me that what he needs is for people who are scheduled to come in on time.

At this point I had realized that anything further I said would be unproductive to both of us and I did not respond. My supervisor at this point responded by removing me from the schedule of this past week.

&amp;#x200B;

Also for more context, I lived with my parents during this time, but on April 11th I got into an argument with my father that resulted in him throwing me out of the house during the pandemic. Thankfully I have amazing friends that love me and are letting me stay in an empty room in their house right now. I am planning on moving out with 2-3 other friends to another city near LA, I have the funds for my share of a down payment, and by working full time I would be able to earn enough for rent and all other utilities. I want to go back to school as well, end game goal is to get my teaching credentials and become a philosophy professor when I'm around 35-55. I started out my first year in Uni as a Computer Science major, but I realized I didn't have the passion to pursue it. So I went undeclared for a while, and later I declared as a double major in Business Administration and Philosophy.  Now I'm considering doing something with engineering because I don't value business, and I would rather equip myself with the tools to build the change I want to see in the world.

,COVID19_support,"Man, this is just the worst time to have Spring allergies, isn't it? Every little tickle in my throat, every hint of a cough, and I worry that I'm developing a case of covid-19. I've been doing all I can to maintain social distance and keep the house clean. Whenever I do have to go out, I wear a mask and gloves and wash diligently when I'm back home on top of it all. I'm doing all I can.

Problem is, my fiance works in essential retail. He's out there risking a lot every day. The only silver lining is that he's in the gardening section of his store which was recently locked. People can still go in and buy stuff but they can't use the registers and he tells me nobody's in there for very long anymore. Well, except to ask for the billionth time if the registers are open then having a hissy fit when they're told no.

But still, it's worrying that he's out there risking his health and by extension my health. As well as the health of my elderly mom who's currently living with us. Were any of us to get sick, I'd be most worried for her. She's over 70 and has asthma.

I don't really know what I'm getting at. I'm just scared. I ricochet between an anxious, despondent mess or cautiously optimistic day after day and I'm just so, so tired.

And now here I am, at 2:30 AM, unable to help but notice that the tickle in my throat has been getting more noticeable over the past few days. But then wondering if it's just my allergies getting a bit worse, as they often do this time of year, because they tend to fade mostly -- but not completely -- when I take an over the counter allergy pill. But then I think about how my fiance has recently been getting more worried, and saying he feels a little odd too, and is uncertain if it's symptoms or just anxiety. He doesn't suffer from allergies like I do, so if he started to develop the same symptoms then I'd be a lot more alarmed.

I don't know what to do. The numbers are so inconsistent. For everyone saying that the vast majority of people recover at home dealing with what feels like, at worst, a nasty flu-adjacent bug, there's someone crawling out of the woodwork to say that there's a flat 5% mortality rate and that everyone is going to get sick sooner or later, and that the death toll will be immeasurable.

The rational part of me knows that the numbers are in me and my family's favor even if we do get sick. But that's the bitch of having clinical depression and anxiety and god only knows what else knocking around my head -- it's really hard to always listen to the rational part.

Yesterday (TMI warning) he had the most epic diarrhea he has ever had. Even as a baby when he had CMPI, i never saw anything like this. Instinct told me to throw everything the poop touched into a hot wash with bleach immediately, before it touched anything else. 

Today, he became lethargic and kept whimpering, his temp was 99 so we assumed he was coming down with something. Within 2 hours he vomited and his temp went up to 100. He felt hot and damp to the touch. Again, i threw everything the vomit touched into a hot wash with bleach, and sprayed everything down with Lysol, instructing Hubby to wash his hands after cleaning Mini up. At this point my gut is telling me what this is, as he is coughing more and his temp seems to be trending up.

Hubby puts Mini to bed, and i call the nurse line. They talk to me for a good 25 minutes and then tell me he has the symptoms that usually present in kids, just that his fever is not high enough right now for them to test him. They say to isolate, give tylenol and fluids and call them back/ call the doctor if his fever gets any higher or his condition worsens.

He felt hot and damp to the touch. Again, i threw everything the vomit touched into a hot wash with bleach, and sprayed everything down with Lysol, instructing Hubby to wash his hands after cleaning Mini up. At this point my gut is telling me what this is, as he is coughing more and his temp seems to be trending up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hubby puts Mini to bed, and i call the nurse line. They talk to me for a good 25 minutes and then tell me he has the symptoms that usually present in kids, just that his fever is not high enough right now for them to test him. They say to isolate, give tylenol and fluids and call them back/ call the doctor if his fever gets any higher or his condition worsens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im shitting myself. He&amp;#39;s a month away from 4. He&amp;#39;s in good health, but im so scared. Im scared he&amp;#39;ll die. Im scared Hubby or i will get it and die.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"It has been 4 weeks since I became sick on 1 April. Originally I had sore throat, headache and muscle pain. Then the sore throat was gone but dry cough started. On the 6 April, I lost my sense of smell completely. I live in the UK and I called NHS for help. After going through some questions, they suggested me to take paracetamol and stay at home. Because I never have fever since I'm ill, the doctor advised me to stay calm and these symptoms will be gone within 4 weeks automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very thankful for NHS and patiently isolated at home for these symptoms to go away even though I feel headache, muscle pain, cough and can't smell every day. Now it's been 4 weeks and these symptoms are still here. I called NHS this morning for help, telling them that I don't feel better and request to get tested. They refused me because there is no evidence that I need to be tested.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am freaking out not only because they refuse to let me get tested but also they have done nothing except keep telling to stay at home. I am suffering everyday, if I die tomorrow, I really want to know what I am dying for.

,COVID19_support,"About 2 weeks ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fxrplw/my_incarcerated_dad_just_tested_positive_and_i_am/) when my dad first tested positive for corona virus. It was very reassuring to see so many people offering their condolences and prayers for him. 

However, today I received a call from a nurse at the hospital he's currently at. 

He is suffering from serious issues in his kidneys. He can no longer breathe on his own. The nurse said, ""we don't want to sugar coat anything. He's probably not going to pull through.""

I'm going to visit him tomorrow for what will probably be the last time. After being wrongfully imprisoned for so long and being up for release *next year,* his story is coming to an abrupt end.

I just don't even know what to do at this point. Everything I have done in my life was because of him. He was always calling to verbally kick my ass whenever he heard I was screwing up. He would always give me support and advice whenever I talked about plans I had of any kind. He was always there for me whenever I needed him, despite being locked away. Nothing could break our bond and nothing could stop him from being a great dad.

His family is part of the reason he's in prison, they no longer speak to him and I returned the favor to them. They're a bunch of dysfunctional, narcissistic assholes. My mom's family is all dead, one of them I lost only 2 years ago. It's just her and my uncle now. It feels like I have nobody left. It feels like I have nothing left. 

All my life and everything I've done was because I loved to hear my dad tell me how proud I was. He showed up to all my football games, even though I never really got to play at all. He always made me handmade birthday cards while he was in prison. He took me to meet celebrities (he was a small time actor that got to play side roles in a lot of blockbuster movies). I know everyone says this same exact thing, but he was the last person I feel should suffer the way he has and is.

I guess maybe I'm acting like a helpless child because I don't have my parent to show me what to do, but that's what I really feel like. I only just turned 22. He is only 48.

,COVID19_support,"Hey so first, anyone with anxiety issues, please go on with your day and I hope all goes well for you. I am just going to ask some people about my current condition with covid. Just go to another thread if it even mildly triggers you

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so I need a bit of help. I started to freak out yesterday night. I don't usually have any kind of panic attacks, but yesterday I think I had one to some degree. A mild one, but yeah, I still am feeling a bit freaked.

Now, I've been dealing with corona virus (tested and confirmed via blood tests and swab in hospital) for over a month, like 40 days almost. I initially got severe symptoms, BUT fortunately avoided complications for the most part.

I got tonsilitis a couple weeks back but its now healed (on top of the corona, just as a mild add on cuz of the infection).

I had always coughed up a bit of blood since the start of my corona, but I put it down to my gingervitis going a little out of control while sick. However, yesterday I coughed up clear phlegm and it had dots of clear red blood in it. And, well... I started freaking out when faced with first clear evidence it was from my lungs. Started shaking (still am shaking).

I decided to go to sleep for several reasons.

Just because it would be pointless to go to hospital as I have already done so for corona and was tested for all infections, and its clear of anything like pneumonia. And I figure that a LONG infection of the lungs is probably highly likely to cause blood in some form. I read some stuff on the net and it seemed like advice wasnt to panic but to go to a doctor.

So, I'm not registered to a gp in the UK cuz I only just moved here, so instead I downloaded a form to register to a gp, and I will seek treatment that way.

...

I just need some help dealing with the shock of it, and dont wanna tell my friends right now for several reasons.

So I think I am doing what is right, and that is a comfort, second a comfort is that its been similar this whole time maybe but I didn't notice (so might just be from the lung damage), and third, I did do something that might have exascerbated this symptom.

I did some exercise. Because, well, I'm going crazy sitting in bed for over a month. I felt a pressure in my chest as I did, which most definately could have caused more blood than normal (it isnt a lot, which on google it says to look for so that is ok).

So I figure I stirred up the junk in my lungs, or opened up little wounds that are in my lungs by causing it to do too much. Those micro cuts bleed a tiny bit into the  mucus and I get what I got.

... I also may have a throat ulcer, from the reflux that comes with the disease but I narrowed it down and the blood isnt from that because I think my throat ulcer is rather mild.

It is just... the pressure from having covid for so long, and it wearing on my body and mind, I need a little help to cope. Initially my covid was bad enough to get rushed to hospital... They were worried because my symptoms were pretty extreme, and worried my body might just suddenly quit out.

But, I held out, my body held out. I knew then how dangerous this was for older folk... if theyd gotten it like I did, I shuddered to think of how easily it could take them out. And I worry still about that. But... now I'm just worried about myself. I just cant believe im still sick 5 weeks on, and coughing blood no less. Its just so frustrating to be captured in this vice grip of unrelenting terror for so long.

I wasn't afraid earlier yesterday, I was like ""I'm so getting past this!"". That is why I exercised, almost like a fist of victory held in the air after a tough battle. Then I cough up blood...

That... is rough...

&amp;#x200B;

I imagine I am still trying to recover, so I have to keep taking it easy... That for example, a man in bandages cant go for a jog without expecting to bleed from the wound. That even victors will bleed after an injury to show they are but human.

But that sight... It was terrifying and brought back the fear. And well corona for me has created a bit of ptsd. I mean, I sometimes get flashbacks to how it felt, and get disoriented and scared. And just yeah, the blood made me have just a really intense version of that.

My room mates are complaining they are still sick too... They tried to go back to work and I told them to stay home. But after 1 day they came back sicker than theyd ever been during the whole process (they just got discomfort and mild shortness of breath, some aches, fatigue, cough, occassional fevers, and heartburn... a mild version but not nice). Now 5 weeks on their symptoms are getting worse. I chalk this up as the virus just being misdiagnosed as cleared in clinical settings after a few weeks, and the data on reinfection actually just being the same infection. So I believe its likely it just keeps going in your system for 2 months or so, so I'm not too surprised.

Just exhausted emotionally. And yeah, some very real ptsd (not as bad as war Id imagine but a different version of it, mild). And that mixing and I feel off. I just want it to leave. And having such a real example it is still here, is about as threatening as learning their is still a weirdo loose in your house looking at you through the air vents.

Is a quiet moment of victory too much to ask. Or must this thing fight with me bitterly to the end.

I suppose it is the latter.

This is so damn bitter. I despise this illness in a way I have never truly despised anything. I'm just still afraid. And that hits a nerve in my pride.

I'm meant to be the tough one. But, I just... need to deal. And while I know mostly how to. My self care is ... not all that kind. I'm a bit callus in how I treat my own mind. I just need some kindness I guess, and all my roomies are cranky, friends are sick or stressed. (scratches head)

,COVID19_support,"So my sister did part time in on a ski resort (some people who were at the resort were confirmed infected).

I think at some point she was coughing a little, and a bit later everyone there was coughing. After everyone had been coughing she came home about 1 or 1.5 weeks later. She said she thought she had  ""mononucleosis"" and not covid, because her complaint was that her throat nodules were swollen. I find it absolutely not believable at all though, and I think it's pretty obvious it's either covid, or a cold if she's already had covid.

Anyway, she's been home now, and she just does not care. I try to take precautions, but I wasn't really safe enough. I use a tool to not touch surfaces, and if I do I wash my hands, even if I just barely touch some part I know isn't safe... But, I only stood maybe 1 meter away from her when she talked to me, repeatedly, so I suspect my face got droplets.... And then I've touched my face, nose, eyes, and mouth, infecting myself (I really should have washed my face after every interaction, and worn a face mask).

I told her to use nitrite gloves and mask when she's in the kitchen, but she thought it was a bother so didn't. Told her to wear a mask when she was around me, but that was also a bother so she didn't. She's going to the city to meet friends, and now going away to a friend who's self quarantined because her/his parents didn't want him/her home due to having been sick at the ski resort.

Our 68 year old dad, who has a somewhat suppressed immunity system, is pretty desperate for social contact... So when she delivered him groceries he invited her for pancakes, but he does at least take some precautions like keeping distance. But still she should not have accepted, because he's at a real risk of actually dying to it.

I think I'm infected, and I know I should be fine.... But there's always the low chance of dying, and I think low chance of permanent damage (just turned 30, and generally healthy, but since allergies can give me breathing problems I'm a little worried). It's such an unnecessary risk, caused by people who don't care for others, and won't take things seriously because it's at odds with their own self-indulgence. It really makes me mad, it's one summer, and it's just some inconvenience to at least reduce the chances of me contracting it. It makes me mad, but serves no purpose to really confront her about it (I've told her what she's doing is stupid, and that she's one of the selfish ones we've talked about a month ago, she acknowledges it but doesn't really care), and I do have to blame my self for not just staying in my room.

If I die to this, I'm gonna be so mad (or won't, but you know).

,COVID19_support,"Hi, Reddit. I'm scared.

&amp;#x200B;

I literally only ever go out of the house for groceries. Nothing else. I usually do the grocery shopping for my family so I take a while getting everything at the store (every time I need to go re-stock, I ask everyone what they need because they're higher risk than me, I'm 28 f, without any known pre-existing conditions, whereas everyone else is either old, diabetic, overweight or all of the above.) I wash my hands constantly, never touch my face, always wear a mask, keep my distance, disinfect everything I purchase, basically I'm being as careful as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I'm still really worried I might have gotten sick. I've been feeling all sorts of weird for a while now. My throat has been sore for days. I had headaches for over a week. My chest is getting this itchy scratchy sensation. There was a time when I'd wake up and my pajamas would make my skin hurt. The only bit that helps me calm down is that I can breathe just fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm developing health anxiety. Every pain, ache, noise, twitch sends me into an uncontrollable spiral of whether I have something, can this kill me, will I die, will my partner die, if I have it did I give it to my family, if I'm sick what will I do when my health insurance is cut off at the end of this month, etc. etc. etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a really hard time trying not to implode. Every day I feel like I'm about to break down, sometimes I just want to curl up and cry. I'm tired, scared, frustrated.

,COVID19_support,"The backstory: about March 19th, everybody in my house, my husband, myself and our 16 year old son started feeling a little bit sick. The boy and I had fevers and stuffy noses and my husband had a fever and body aches. The next day, the boy and I felt better, no fever and we just figured that are stuffy noses were due to allergies which we both have. My husband continue to get sicker and sicker, and ended up being positive covid-19 and spending 22 days in the hospital, 13 of them on the ventilator. He's been home since Monday morning after testing negative in the hospital twice.
Shortly after he went to the hospital, my son and I went through a drive-thru testing site to be tested for current active virus. My test was negative and we never received the results of his. Neither of us has gotten sick in this time.
We got approval to go to the new drive-thru antibody testing site at a local medical office. We were given pin-prick blood tests and told to park and wait for our results. Then a group of people came up to the car and told me that my son was negative, but I tested positive for one of the antibodies and that I might have the virus right now. They told me that I needed to quarantine myself for 14 days, which is impossible, as I am my husband's caregiver and he is not able to take care of himself at all right now.
They then proceeded to give me the nasal swab, and I have to wait two more days for that test. I really don't know what to do to keep my family and myself safe right now. My son is not able to nor is it his place to take care of his dad. If my husband already had the virus, I'm pretty sure I won't be able to give it to him, so maybe I should just have my son stay away from me as much as possible.

,COVID19_support,"Hello all, I hope you're doing well during these times.

I recently was broken up with by a woman who I had been seeing long distance for the last few months. I really cared for her and always tried to make an effort to be there for her emotionally. Before the pandemic, things had become rocky between us and I was trying to set things up so we could see each other again, made plans and such. We agreed to see each other again and I was hopeful. Then the pandemic started and derailed all of those plans to rekindle our romance. I was supposed to move to an area near her for work, that didn't happen either. I let her know that I would be there for her if she needed me, since she told me she was depressed and anxious due to her being vulnerable, but because of the distance and other things, she broke up with me and blocked me on everything. It broke my heart because I cared for her dearly. I apologized to her but she never responded to me. It's most likely over between us. I'll never see her again and I feel so awful. It's my fault this happened.

Now I'm stuck at home, in a job that I can't physically be at, with a broken heart and feeling like its all my fault. I wish this damned pandemic never happened. My life could have been so much better right now. I cry every day wishing that things could be different. I curse my terrible luck. I'm slowly turning to drinking and sleeping all day to cope with the pain of all of this. I'm slipping down into a terrible depression. I can't see anyone because I'm afraid I'll get them sick.

,COVID19_support,"I work at a community college as a cleaner. We also have a pre-school of about 100 kids or so dining in our cafeteria, adult students who live in our student houses on site and we also have a hostel with a shared kitchen. This is also in the same building as the student kitchen is located in, they're just on different floors. Students cook for themselves on weekends and holidays when school is closed.

Since Corona happened, all of our adult education is now online and only a few of our students live on site. We still clean very thoroughly after all the kids have used the cafeteria- which they do 3 times a day- and we've all had to lower our work-hours but try to clean all surfaces as effectively as possible to lower the risk of a potential outbreak.

Two weeks ago we had a new guest move into the hostel. I thought nothing of it, it was the only guest we had since you know- corona. We had a small note in our booking program and that's it. No worries. I went up there and did my job as you do. After the first time I had been up there, my coworker told me that the administrative staff and our boss had told her that the guest is actually in quarantine and that I and our other coworkers should be careful. At first I thought nothing of it as that coworker sometimes can exaggerate things. She did seem pretty shaken up tho. I even asked one in the kitchen staff if she knew anything about it as I had not gotten any information about that. She said no, and was fairly sure we would all get information about that if that was the case. So I shook it off but I made a point of wearing gloves when I went up there to clean. I even met the guest when I took the trash out but I tried to not let some work gossip spook me.

Until yesterday. I was cleaning like normally, walking between the buildings back and forth, trying to get as much done as possible during my short 4-hour shift when I meet my boss. My boss is complaining that the hostel is messy, that there's dirty sheets and dirty dishes in the sink. The cleaner who normally looks after that particular building is sick so I said I can go up there and take care of it but it's the guests responsibility to wash their dishes.(this is no luxurious place and guests are expected to keep it tidy after themselves) I asked half-jokingly if the guest was truly in quarantine. My boss suddenly starts to look away and appeared very stressed. She tried to avoid the question somewhat, saying that it's not really quarantine but yes, kind of quarantine, that the guest is fine, not sick, not infected, no chance. She then says the guest has been on a missionary trip in a country in north Africa and had just returned home and had nowhere to go. And then she acted even more stressed and said she had to go and quickly scurried away.

I was taken aback since that felt like kind of important information to share with your cleaning staff. I asked the person in charge of booking rooms right after this who confirmed that YES, the guest in question is in quarantine, and then she waved me off. I kind of started to panic. Me and both of my colleagues had been up there wearing little to no protection what so ever. We clean everywhere else, we're all over the place. I had met the guest and they did not appear sick but this is more about management not telling us that there was someone of potential risk self-quarantining. To be honest I freaked out. It is VERY common for management to not tell us very important information. They usually just give orders and expect us to obey, never tell us things in advance etc. But this felt more serious. We're in the middle of a pandemic and are not told about someone choosing to quarantine themselves after a long trip abroad and after having been at multiple airports in our hostel? My coworker had cleaned up there last week with no gloves and now she's sick.

I called my supervisor about this who freaked out about us not being told about someone who is potentially contagious. We have multiple high-risk people in our staff. My dad is high risk so she tried to help me get to the bottom of this if the guest was really quarantining or not. My supervisor tried to call our boss multiple times but she refused to pick up, same with our other boss and the person who do the bookings. No one answered. Finally I texted my boss and said it is urgent that I know since none of my parents can go to work if they or anyone in their family has been in contact with anyone that's been abroad lately. She finally called me and said she didn't know anything about where I got that from, that she had NEVER heard of our guest being in quarantine even though she herself told me so just hours before. She then called a bunch of other people, including the guest themselves, and then got back to me. She tried to shake it all of, that she had never ever told my coworker that the guest was in quarantine, she had never mentioned it, actually she had nothing to do with the guest and knew nothing about them. So why answer yes when I asked?

I dropped it and said sorry for the trouble, good that it's all cleared up now. My supervisor however insisted that she and my boss should have a meeting the day after. It ends up with my boss refusing to answer any questions my supervisor has, my boss even refused to come into work so that she didn't have to speak to my supervisor. And now they sent out an email saying all staff had been notified about the guest on the 10th of April and that the guest now had moved out and that there was nothing to worry about. There is no such email. No one of the other staff-members knew we even had a guest. And if all staff had been notified about the situation, why did no one that I asked correct me? I feel awful, I’m doubting my own sanity and all I wanted to know was if the guest was in quarantine or not. Way too late now, 14 days have passed almost to the minute and the guest moved out. It just feels like I have put myself, my family and others in harms way. The thought of how much I could’ve potentially spread the virus around unknowingly makes me sick. I feel like a crazy person. My boss is denying everything she said yesterday, my other boss had refused to even look or say hello to my other coworker. I definitely do not trust my boss. They’re acting like this never happened, like we - the cleaning staff- are overreacting and gossiping and lying even though I went straight for answers when I heard it from them. I live in Sweden. We don’t test people so we have no way of knowing how many cases there truly are. You’re only tested if you need to be hospitalized. Am I going crazy to think that this was not okay?

We&amp;#39;re in the middle of a pandemic and are not told about someone choosing to quarantine themselves after a long trip abroad and after having been at multiple airports in our hostel? My coworker had cleaned up there last week with no gloves and now she&amp;#39;s sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called my supervisor about this who freaked out about us not being told about someone who is potentially contagious. We have multiple high-risk people in our staff. My dad is high risk so she tried to help me get to the bottom of this if the guest was really quarantining or not. My supervisor tried to call our boss multiple times but she refused to pick up, same with our other boss and the person who do the bookings. No one answered. Finally I texted my boss and said it is urgent that I know since none of my parents can go to work if they or anyone in their family has been in contact with anyone that&amp;#39;s been abroad lately. She finally called me and said she didn&amp;#39;t know anything about where I got that from, that she had NEVER heard of our guest being in quarantine even though she herself told me so just hours before. She then called a bunch of other people, including the guest themselves, and then got back to me. She tried to shake it all of, that she had never ever told my coworker that the guest was in quarantine, she had never mentioned it, actually she had nothing to do with the guest and knew nothing about them. So why answer yes when I asked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped it and said sorry for the trouble, good that it&amp;#39;s all cleared up now. My supervisor however insisted that she and my boss should have a meeting the day after. It ends up with my boss refusing to answer any questions my supervisor has, my boss even refused to come into work so that she didn&amp;#39;t have to speak to my supervisor. And now they sent out an email saying all staff had been notified about the guest on the 10th of April and that the guest now had moved out and that there was nothing to worry about. There is no such email. No one of the other staff-members knew we even had a guest. And if all staff had been notified about the situation, why did no one that I asked correct me? I feel awful, I’m doubting my own sanity and all I wanted to know was if the guest was in quarantine or not. Way too late now, 14 days have passed almost to the minute and the guest moved out. It just feels like I have put myself, my family and others in harms way. The thought of how much I could’ve potentially spread the virus around unknowingly makes me sick. I feel like a crazy person. My boss is denying everything she said yesterday, my other boss had refused to even look or say hello to my other coworker. I definitely do not trust my boss. They’re acting like this never happened, like we - the cleaning staff- are overreacting and gossiping and lying even though I went straight for answers when I heard it from them. I live in Sweden. We don’t test people so we have no way of knowing how many cases there truly are. You’re only tested if you need to be hospitalized. Am I going crazy to think that this was not okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boss didn&amp;#39;t tell us about and later denied hostel guest being in quarantine after a very long missionary trip abroad and having been to multiple airports. We had been up there multiple times and I even met the guest/was less than 1 metre away from them without protective gear.&lt;/p&gt;

So as of April 15 I’ve been living with them.
On the night of April 20, which is 5 days since I’ve been home so pretty spot on for when symptoms should show, I heard my mom coughing. Since then I’ve been a ball of anxiety and sadness. I’ve asked my mom about how she feels a few times and usually get that she feels not great but not worried. I’m too afraid to ask most times or for any more info, which makes me feel so cowardly and weak. AFAIK the only symptom she has is the cough, but the cough seems to be getting slightly worse. When I ask my dad, he says he has no complaints except for “allergies”. We all got tested earlier this week (my dad keeps saying only because I’ve just returned from overseas and was on an airplane etc) and will get results sometime next week. Today I’m going to tell my mom to call her doctor and also ask them to give me their doctors phone numbers in case of emergency.

,COVID19_support,This is long but please bear with me. My daughter will most likely have to go in for emergency dental treatment this week. She was supposed to have dental surgery at a children’s hospital because of her health conditions (cancer survivor and others) but everything is canceled. She was hospitalized with a ‘regular’ pneumonia last year and it was awful and two other times for viruses that really got her bad.

,COVID19_support,"I have an online friend who I've known for like eleven years. We've never met in person but were planning to soon when the pandemic hit.

Today she told me she's displaying some early symptoms. Headache, low-grade fever, a sore throat, coughing and fatigue. She's scared, and I'm scared too. 

I convinced her to try to get tested in the morning if her fever doesn't go down. I also told her to stay hydrated, get some rest, and stay calm.

I'm so scared of losing someone to this virus, I don't know if I could go on if I did. I feel like I'm already in mourning even though I know that if she does indeed have it (which she might not, there's that too) she has a pretty good chance of being fine.

I did not mention the statistics to her because she did not ask. I worried that if I did, they might scare instead of comforting her, which is what they do to me and many others due to the fear of becoming the outlier.  She's in her late 20's, I know her chances of survival if she is indeed positive are good, but I don't want to put any more stress on her than she's already dealing with, and we all have a tendency to focus on that fraction of a percent instead of the far larger percentage in our favor.

I love her so much, she's one of my best friends, and the mere idea of her having the virus is tearing me apart. I have a serious problem with dwelling in the worst case scenario and worrying until I can't function. I knew, statistically that someone I knew would probably catch it if I didn't catch it myself, but now that it's possibly happened, I'm terrified. Completely paralyzed at the thought of losing someone to this.

I am deliberately going out of my way to not freak her out. I know that additional stress is not good for the immune system. It's also not about me, and I'm not trying to make it about me.

,COVID19_support,"Hey guys! I'm proud of this so I wanted to share!

I've struggled with severe anxiety panic attacks and agoraphobia for years

Talking with my therapist one day she told me about the rubber band technique, it's simple you wear a rubber band and whenever you have anxiety or negative thoughts you snap the band on your wrist and its a good way to ground yourself and focus and bring you back down to earth! 

This helped me a lot but there were a few issues rubber bands aren't very strong so they break often. They also aren't very aesthetic.

So it got me thinking so I made the snap-out bracelet! 
It follows the same principle but they are made of high elastic rubber and silicon so they last and they also look so much better and raise awareness for mental health! 

I wanted to do some good so every one sold $1 is donated to NAMI ( National Alliance on Mental Illness)

,COVID19_support,"Hi everyone,

I've been feeling sick with on and off symptoms of what I suspect to be covid for 5 weeks. The only thing is that I tested negative for the virus (but negative for flu and other respiratory viruses as well), but nonetheless my doctor is convinced that I got a false negative. She has been informed that up to 40 percent of tests or more may be false negatives. I just wish I knew what I actually have, because I'm unfortunately immunocompromised with a few chronic illnesses.

Honestly, I'm still grateful to have my job as it pays well and they're mostly understanding about my situation. However, as a technology consultant I tend to have long hours and I think I may need some extra time off to just rest. I don't want to let down my development team but I just need to fight off this illness. I can get short term disability at full salary, pending acceptance of my insurance claim. Still, I feel the need to power through this..

I've been to the ER twice since the onset from the shortness of breath and was sent home with an inhaler and some azithromycin. My symptoms started March 12 with noticeable exhaustion, sore throat, dizziness and shortness of breath. The next day I felt like it was a bad cold, and then that weekend I felt like I was run over by a truck with intense body aches, chest tightness, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, just any random symptom you could think of. It's April 22 now and I still feel sick on and off. The symptoms seem to come in waves, and everytime I think it's done it comes back again. I used to fly weekly for work and I tend to get sick easily, so I would not at all be surprised if I had picked it up at the airport.

Today I'm feeling worse. Slight fever, it feels like there's fluid stuck in my lymph nodes, throat and chest. Worst part is the headache, body aches, exhaustion and chest tightness. Sense of smell is..off for a lack of a better term. It's duller than usual. I'm not necessarily coughing involuntarily but I feel the urge to cough and clear my throat and chest often.

My blood oxygen dips as low as 90 and as high as 97 so it's very hard to tell how sick I really am. I'm using my inhaler every few hours. I'm trying my hardest to get 8 hours of sleep but I feel too bad to fall asleep 🤕 all the online symptoms checkers say to go back to get medical care but I just know they're going to send me back home as I dont have a particularly high fever

Is my lyme disease making this worse? I'm only 23 but I'm afraid of permanent damage to my body.. I honestly get terrified at times. I don't want to suffocate in my sleep 😐

At the very least, there are positives to this. I've been able to reconnect with friends and family, and people seem to be a bit kinder online :) I just need to take it day by day, it seems. I look forward to a future where I can travel again. Hopefully we can get some antibody testing soon!

Had a very strange situation earlier, but need to rewind a smidgen. Last week, I made homemade pasta- flour, salt, oil, and eggs. Easy peasy. But, I could tell as I was making it, the pasta had a very strange smell. Just weird. And, then when I ate it, it tasted weird too; it tasted like it smelled. Just strange. I attributed it to bad eggs or oil or something and moved on. 

Now, today, I had homemade biscuits. No ingredients were the same. With the biscuits, a different flour was used (Cake flour, instead of AP for the pasta) This time, there wasn't a noticeable smell difference. I only smelled it when it was right up to my nose. And I could smell something a lil different. But, the taste was similar. Not as strong as the pasta, but there was a little hint of something there. I smelled all the ingredients separately. None of them smelled strange. 

Other than this, I have not experienced taste/smell loss. And nothing else seems to have a noticeable difference in taste.

,COVID19_support,"Thank you all so much for your reassurance about my mom a few weeks ago. An update: Turns out I did not get my mother sick. But I’ve been at home for the past five weeks still going through whatever it is I have (cough, high heart rate, no appetite, just random symptoms - this sucks!)

Now my mother said she had diarrhea two days ago and she sounds like she’s developing a cough. My dad, who has diabetes, kidney stones, and had a stroke 2 years ago said he had a runny nose and sounded like he had chills a couple nights ago.

,COVID19_support,"I live in the UK and things have been pretty scary, of course I look at other countries and see it being worse and I keep trying to remind myself that it could be worse but now I'm truly terrified to return back to work.

I got a phone call today from my boss that the company is now deemed essential work. It's not, we are the most unessential work I can ever think of, but they have found a flaw in what is deemed essential work and has gotten us temporary essential work as it means they can make money rather than losing it - I truly know our company would do this as they tried to pull it off during the lockdown but were unable to find work so put us on furlough. Our company has always been very upfront that making money is the most important thing to them, we are underpaid and even when we as workers took them to court and we won they have still found ways to underpay us. It's a place I would never recommend anyone to work but alas my job hunt has been put on hold due to the lockdown.

So obviously when our furlough ends in 2 weeks we will be expected to all attend work or not get paid, I flat out refused to attend next week as you give up furlough and you have to be at risk of catching this. I'm high risk, my company knows this but otherwise I'm a young and healthy person and that's what they seem to focus on but the job they are asking us to do is to travel across the country and be in places with the general public for 10 hours a day with no protection (Apparently PPE makes us look unprofessional and have been banned from being used). Take that in comparison where I haven't left my house since the lockdown began except to get milk because I ran out during the first week and have been lucky enough to have food delivered. My company don't have a good track record for retention so how they can expect us to actually feel that they are going to have our best interests at heart when they've only ever been worried about lining their pockets is what truly scares me. But if I don't go in I'm going to be out of furlough for who knows how long and who says they won't find a person to replace me because I'm refusing to work.

I have the ultimate respect for those who are still working and I hope all of y'all are able to remain safe somehow, but I don't know what to do. I sent an email to my MP stating my concerns a few weeks ago (When the lockdown was brought in) and he said they were trying to do all they could to ensure that people felt safe to attend work. But that's really not good enough. How can a company which is not at all essential work decide to 'rebrand' and make us do essential work and if we don't, we don't get paid. And sick pay only works if you're actually sick so I can't even use that.

I'm not special, I don't have much to give in life but that doesn't mean I wish to be putting myself into something where I'm truly terrified I will die from. If I die, my parents have no one and my Mum is as high risk as they get, if they survive and I die then I won't be able to look after them when the time comes and I can't fathom them seeing their only child die because they were told to go to work as an essential worker with no protection. I don't really know what to do and I've just been crying since the phone call. I thought I was strong but I'm anything but. I just wish I knew everything would be fine and that I didn't feel like I was needing to place my life on the line to be able to try and live. I'm so lost.

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far, I'm just really looking for some support.

,COVID19_support,"So this is a thing that keeps rattling in my head.

I'm in the UK, I work non essential retail so I'm on furlough until further notice. I feel  it's likely going to be sooner rather than later that non essential retail starts opening up again and I'll be back at work.

Where I work is somewhere that pre-pandemic would get a lot of customers from out of my town, and due to transport links would get a lot of tourists from europe and further. On a really busy day I'd say we'd typically serve between 100-200 customers, on an 'average' quiet day we'd be serving 30-50 in the weeks leading to the lockdown where shops there gradually closed up we'd struggle to get 10-20 customers in. 

And honestly, I am concerned.

I work in a fairly small shop located within a shopping centre. Like on busy pre-pandemic days we'd have problems fitting in more than say 10 customers in the shop without it getting horribly cramped. We also don't really have much counter space and can just about fit two people behind there when we're working the tills. It's really hard to process delivery because we straight up don't have the room to move some days. 

And like I know where I work enforcing social distancing is near impossible, there's no easy way to enforce a 2metre distance between customers unless we did something super extreme like only let one person in at a time, which I also know likely wouldn't work. Because I work in a sort of shop where people often do need to take their time to find what they want so that just wouldn't work for us at all. 

Can't really put any sort of shielding on the counter. Pre outbreak we were sent gloves for the till and hand sanitiser and that was all they'd give us.

I also feel from a financial point it seems a bit silly because I doubt many people are going to want to come out shopping anyway and I don't think what we sell will be in much demand because no one can travel anywhere so I don't think there's much call for like 65 litre backpacks, walking books and sleeping bags etc in the coming months since we'd normally be starting to get people in wanting to prep for their summer holidays, scout camps and so on.",t2_gn4jz,False,,0,False,Concerned about going back to work,[],r/COVID19_support,False,,,0,,False,t3_g6c75y,False,dark,1.0,,restricted,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1587627967.0,text,,,,text,self.COVID19_support,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is a thing that keeps rattling in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s really hard to process delivery because we straight up don&amp;#39;t have the room to move some days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like I know where I work enforcing social distancing is near impossible, there&amp;#39;s no easy way to enforce a 2metre distance between customers unless we did something super extreme like only let one person in at a time, which I also know likely wouldn&amp;#39;t work. Because I work in a sort of shop where people often do need to take their time to find what they want so that just wouldn&amp;#39;t work for us at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t really put any sort of shielding on the counter. Pre outbreak we were sent gloves for the till and hand sanitiser and that was all they&amp;#39;d give us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel from a financial point it seems a bit silly because I doubt many people are going to want to come out shopping anyway and I don&amp;#39;t think what we sell will be in much demand because no one can travel anywhere so I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s much call for like 65 litre backpacks, walking books and sleeping bags etc in the coming months since we&amp;#39;d normally be starting to get people in wanting to prep for their summer holidays, scout camps and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

We had an all-time great trip: we went out to bars, restaurants, a theme park, a packed rowdy screening of Cats. Things in my personal life had finally started going right and I was really excited that 2020 was going to be my year, where I could have minimal stress and just enjoy life with my steady, good job and all I'd really need to worry about was the election (I live in the US).

All I've been able to think about today for the past 24 hours is that I should've blown my brains out the minute I dropped my friend off at the airport, because life will never be that good again. No one's going to be flying to visit anyone. Movie theaters are fucked. Theme parks are fucked. Bars will slowly reopen with five people and most of them probably won't financially survive long enough to do even that. And if all that wasn't enough, we're barreling towards an economic collapse worse than the Great Depression and quite frankly, the election isn't looking great, because the postal service is collapsing and there's no way in-person voting will be safe by November and frankly that's if Trump doesn't go full fucking dictator and cancel the thing under ""public safety concerns"".

I'm seriously considering if I should just take an essential job and voluntarily forgo PPE and give the paycheck to someone immunocompromised who needs it and let whatever happens happen, because I am no longer a valuable or useful person to society, and it's all going to shit anyway, I might as well make life a little better for someone who has kids or more value to the world on my way out.

,COVID19_support,"I know that nobody can know the answer to this... but it's hard to find the 'right' kind of speculation on this topic, or any for that matter, anymore as the news has gotten so diluted... if you know what I mean. I used to have a sort of routine and a few go-to sources, even a few that opposed each other in order to get a well-rounded perspective, but things are so all-over-the-place that I can't find that any more.

I know that my problem isn't as big as the ones of those who are critically ill or losing loved ones... but it's really big for me. I'm 24 and my husband is 25. We just got married in the fall. I returned to the US in January to start my visa process while he remained overseas. A month ago the process was suspended for everyone in the system. We had paid for the priority service and I was supposed to be getting my papers back within 30 days of submission. It was day 28 for me when it was all put on pause. I was so close.

Since then we've been trying to figure out what to do. At first, we were really freaking out and looking at all of our possibilities. It is still possible for him to come to the US as he is exempt from the travel ban on the basis of being my spouse, but that would have been really difficult for him because he's still calling into work remotely, which wouldn't necessarily be legal for him to do here and would start at 4am every day. We decided to just wait another month and see what happens. A lot of people at his company are getting furloughed and he may be too. I don't know how that will affect my visa status, our future, anything. I don't know how I can handle that additional level of uncertainty for us on top of all of this while still being apart. 

I've been taking things one day at a time and feeling like maybe bans would start to be lifted by May or June, maybe they'd figure out what to do with those of us who are in visa limbo, maybe there would be strict regulations for travel that would make things moderately safer... I don't know.

But sometimes it looks like it starts to go backward... with Trump banning immigration to the US. My husband should still be allowed in... as he is not immigrating, just coming on a visiting basis... but I don't know how things will snowball from there.

I can handle another month, maybe two. I'll find some way to get through that. But if it starts dragging on past that point I don't know how to cope. 

In terms of the actual logistics of travel, we would do so with as much conceivable caution as possible with self-isolation at the beginning and end of the journey. 

I also don't believe in making exceptions just for us, like I think that we should all be looking at what we can do on an individual basis but in terms of this particular issue, there are a lot of other people hurting and families that are separated... which is especially difficult during this time of extreme uncertainty and unease. I will 100% hunker down and wait for the sake of saving lives, not contributing to the overwhelm of hospitals, etc. But there's only so long that you can prevent families from being together... and not to repeat Trump here by any means... 

I'm wondering what direction to think in here. It's easy to get all doomsday or down about it and think that this lockdown could last for a year or more... but there's the other side of it where they're going to *have* to find a way to get some movement going again before that, even if it's limited.... Or issue travel permits on the basis of application such as *""I need to get back to my husband""*... whereas *""I want to go on a holiday""* wouldn't cut it.

,COVID19_support,"This whole situation has been a nightmare for me ever since it began. I was concerned when I first heard about the virus but figured it would be just like other coronavirus outbreaks and be relatively easily contained, that we'd never see it in the States, that it would be a local tragedy in the place it first cropped up but leave the rest of the world unscathed. But world leaders and health organizations dropped the ball and now it's everywhere.

I know this is so small in the grand scheme of things but the main thoughts I'm having these days are how this is taking the 2020 I thought I'd have away from me. I also think of the world as a whole, how unfair this all is for everyone, how this shouldn't be happening. How no one deserves any of the impact this is causing, especially for those who have suffered more loss than I. But I'm still missing the year I thought we would have. My fiance and I got engaged in September 2019 on our fourth anniversary after a generally fantastic 2019 all around. We began planning our wedding for September 2020 and I felt so optimistic. I felt like the world was ours. We were going to top 2019 and have a wonderful wedding and a lovely honeymoon and find the perfect new house for just the two of us and our dog. 2020 was going to be our year.

Now I can't even see my fiance. We live in separate households--he with his parents and sister and her boyfriend, I with my parents--and I haven't held him since March 25th. I dropped off his birthday present at his house a few days ago and the distance I had to keep killed me. I used to see him daily. Wake up, go to work, go to his house, go back to my parents' house. Now I can't see him at all. On top of the general mental stress of the situation, the industry I work in struggling, and coming to terms with reality, I can't even see the one person who always makes me feel better except through a screen. And that's just not the same.

This morning, my fiance told me his sister is very sick and showing some symptoms of COVID-19. She's going to the doctor today. With the lack of testing in my state, I'm skeptical they'll even test her. So I don't even know yet if she has it or not but I feel hopeless either way. My mind is telling me that, even if she doesn't have it now, she or her boyfriend will probably pick it up from being in the doctor's office. And they'll take it back to the house if it isn't already there. And everyone will get infected and suffer. I've read stories of whole families dying. I'm so scared. What if she dies? What if my fiance dies? What if they all die? They're all my family, in some ways more so than my actual family. I can't lose them. What if that brief visit to drop off presents is the last time I ever see my fiance?

I can't stop asking why this is all happening. Not just to me but to everyone. This isn't fair. It isn't fair. I just want to wake up and find out the whole global situation was a weird nightmare I had and just go back to normal.

,COVID19_support,"Here's an article worth discussing about, one that you would never see posted elsewhere on reddit:

[https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-does-not-discriminate-by-body-weight/](https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-does-not-discriminate-by-body-weight/)

**tldr** \- Nutritionist Christy Harrison is essentially saying that results claiming COVID to be a 'fat people killer' are still inconclusive (and possibly inaccurate) due to limited data and poorly managed control groups in reports so far.

**My take** \- As someone who has a BMI of 42 (and dropping!), though under age 30 with no other conditions, reading this is a diamond in the rough. I think many of us can use any article that takes a step back from all those ""OMG FAT PEOPLE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE FROM COVID"" stories (which r/Coronavirus eats up) and gives their own well-researched take on this.

That said, I still believe obesity is a risk factor for COVID (though can be said of many diseases, so for me it's par for the course) and should remain listed as such. If nothing else, it could save lives of people who otherwise may never show a care in the world about this. However, at the risk of sounding like I'm justifying myself, I can't be the only one who thinks it's overkill to tell fat people with no other conditions (particularly in the 20-39 age group) to take as many precautions as someone who is say highly immunocompromised and/or very old. As my doctor even said, everyone should be taking the same precautions regardless.

In the end though, even the highest risk people are far more likely to survive, but let's face it, that'd be too boring for news....

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr&lt;/strong&gt; - Nutritionist Christy Harrison is essentially saying that results claiming COVID to be a &amp;#39;fat people killer&amp;#39; are still inconclusive (and possibly inaccurate) due to limited data and poorly managed control groups in reports so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My take&lt;/strong&gt; - As someone who has a BMI of 42 (and dropping!), though under age 30 with no other conditions, reading this is a diamond in the rough. I think many of us can use any article that takes a step back from all those &amp;quot;OMG FAT PEOPLE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE FROM COVID&amp;quot; stories (which &lt;a href=""/r/Coronavirus""&gt;r/Coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; eats up) and gives their own well-researched take on this.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"Hi all,

First off, I'd like to start by saying I'm a bit nervous to share this, as I don't want anyone to think I'm minimising the seriousness of what's currently going on. But at the same time, the goal behind the project is to help people and perhaps there are some folks in here who could use it.

I'm a musician originally from Vancouver, but currently based in London, England. As my industry has largely collapsed due to the pandemic, I found myself unemployed and feeling very hopeless. I was seeing and hearing a lot of scary things and felt powerless to do anything to help. So I came up with the idea for 'Remote Support', where I'm trying to get people from all over to send me 2-3 minute long videos of where they are isolating from and some of their feelings, no matter what they are. I then write calming music for the videos and then post them to instagram and youtube (giving credit to the sender of course).

My parents are both essential workers, but as of right now they are fine (thank god). Me on the other hand, for 4 days I’ve been struggling a lot with shortness of breath and a tight chest with some pain every now and then. I get winded by just walking around sometimes and other times I feel a little better. It comes and goes. 

I kept telling myself it was just my seasonal allergies but I’ve never had allergies that have hurt me this badly before. I used to have asthma 10 years ago, but what are the odds of it suddenly coming back right now when there’s a virus going around? I don’t know. 

I went to the doctor a few days ago and she said my lungs sound strong and it might just be allergies. I ended up not being able to swallow at some point last night and started to panic so I ended up going to the hospital. They did an xray and my lungs look good so I’m happy for that.. but it could still be the virus and just more mild so it doesn’t show up. This is because they asked me a few times if I wanted to do the test but since it’s so expensive I didn’t want to add more bills to the pile we already have. 

I noticed these symptoms getting worse about 4 days ago and I had McDonald’s 5/6 days ago. I didn’t think it could spread from food because that’s what everyone is saying.. but is it possible? 
As of right now my symptoms are:
-Chest tightness and just feeling full of mucus
- a teeny bit loss of taste but not really. It comes and goes. 
-my temperature has been overall normal but it has gone up to 98-99 a few times and then back down to my regular 96.
-no runny nose, I just sneeze every now and then but I think that’s allergy related. 
-I think I can smell just fine but it might be a little bit less strong for me. 
- I cough but only when I feel like I want to get mucus out, I don’t have to cough 24/7. 

That’s it. Even the doctors aren’t sure because they think it could be asthma, allergies, the virus, acute bronchitis.. list goes on. Does anyone else have similar symptoms or can relate?

,COVID19_support,"**Context:** I live in Mississippi. Adams County, if it's relevant.

I live with my mother and father, my father is a sorry dumb-ass that's drunk most of the time. He's not violent, in-fact he's physically kind of pathetic.But he does live here and his disability check goes towards bills, his name is on paperwork, etc. By all accounts he has a legal right to be here I guess.

**Problem:** He (father) informed us this weekend that he's going to a funeral. We've told him not to, but he just acts like a stubborn child and says ""I'm Going"". He re-iterates ""masks will be provided"" (the crummy 'better than nothing' home-made masks, I'm sure).

I have reason to believe this funeral is being planned under the radar. I haven't seen it in the paper. It's being held at a church outside of town, one of the family members dug the grave ffs. I have no doubt that the gathering will consist of more than ten people, this isn't a responsible or well-educated lot, and that description is being kind.

I've called the Mississippi Covid Hotline and they just told me to call my local authorities, I called my authorities and got what I guess was a secretary, who didn't seem to pay much mind and just said I needed to confirm it was more than 10 people.

My mom has a weakened immune-system, I'm sure I do as well, being somewhat overweight.  I don't want my father going to a large gathering and returning home as an A-symptomatic carrier to infect me or my mother or both of us. Especially considering that we don't even know for sure what this man died from, we DO know he had a tumor on his liver and a weakened immune system himself.

So I really don't know what to do. It's been half a decade since I asked reddit for advice, I like to try to tackle issues on my own, but I'm at my wit's end here.

If he wants to infect himself, fine. But how can I protect myself and my mother?

I figure my best shot is to get the unauthorized gathering shut down, but I don't know the best way to do it. Who can I call?

I feel extremely trapped and like many really important experiences were taken from me. I know others have experienced the same thing or much worse, but the problem is I keep constantly ruminating on about it.

I keep feeling a need to do something to replace graduation, half a semester of being at a school I loved, a full-paid trip abroad and presenting my work at a conference (which was very exciting for me). I really don’t want to just sit in my house like I’ve done the past 5 weeks the day I graduate. But I’m not about to be an idiot and do something stupid. People say just wait till this blows over...but a lot of people are anticipating this will be a problem that lasts till at least next year. I thought about doing a long hiking trip this summer, but trails are currently closed and I am not about to do something dangerous.

This is a follow up to my post. I appreciate everyone who responded, you guys are super awesome and very supportive... Things have gone differently than I expected over the last few weeks.

I went home to see my mom in PA (I know I should not have traveled but it broke my heart to know that she was dealing with this on her own). She had tested positive for COVID about 3-4 weeks ago but was still scared that she could give it to me. So we exchanged sad glances, cried a lot in the same house but not too close together, wore masks and gloves, and talked about my older brother. It was really hard. My mom hasn't cried in a long time, she's had to be strong her whole life (as an immigrant woman) and the possibility of losing her son is really hard for both of us.

My brother has been making very small improvements in his oxygenation over the span of 3 weeks that he has been sedated and intubated. Friday Apr 17,2020 they did a tracheotomy where they inserted the ventilator tube directly into his neck (after surgically cutting his neck open) so that he would be more comfortable. It looks horribly painful and I feel awful. I can't imagine how he's going to feel about it when he wakes up. He is making improvements, they put him on the plasma donation list so I hope that he receives the treatment and I hope it doesn't negatively affect him. I feel so guilty not being able to stay home with my mom in PA but I don't have that many vacation days from my job and we are still open (pharmacy).

It's a long road ahead. I can't really get his case manager to call me back about his insurance, he underwent a lot of procedures (ct scans, xrays, surgery, anesthesia, all the drugs he's on) and I need to know if they are billed correctly because he has UMR insurance through his company. I know money isn't supposed to be important right now, but we're middle class and the financial strain afterwards can be a lot (especially for my mom who has struggled with a compulsive gambling husband most of her life).

I worry about his post-ICU recovery. Will he be the same? Will he be able to think the same? I worry that he will have a lot of mental issues in relation to his stay at the ICU. I feel that he might have a lot more depression, anxiety, some PTSD, and I can't even be there to help my mom if he gets upset, hits her (by accident), or my mom or my brother falls down.

Things are looking up (medically speaking) but I still cry a lot and worry about if he could get potentially worse. It's heartbreaking. Everyday I just feel so guilty about all of it and wish this was just some bad fever dream. Thank you guys for reading. I appreciate any comments and sorry for the long time between updates.

tldr; I didn't update a long time about my 31 y/o brother who was given 2 days to live. Went home to see my mom, brother went from ventilator to tracheal tube for ventilator. Things are looking up, worried about continued care, after care from ICU, and bills.

I took the emergency paid leave offered but the problem is that ends soon and once it does im SoL unless i apply for FMLA.

,COVID19_support,"Before I begin, all of my family has been tested and I am the only one that was positive. As strange as that is, it's definitely a good strange and an enormous relief.

I immediately went into isolation mode after the NY PAUSE lockdown. The last time I can remember seeing any of my family, besides my mother was in late March after they decided to close schools.

I am (now was) in the middle of a move, so I would often go over to the house. I spoke to one contractor and a few delivery guys, but we were all practicing social distancing. They were wearing N95s when we were told not to wear masks. I was following the CDC guidelines; keeping 6 feet, sanitizing my hands, and doing everything I possibly could to avoid touching my face.

My mother has also been where I've been living (a condominium) helping me with packing. Even then, we tried to stay 6 feet apart and were constantly washing our hands.

On April 5, I had to pick up my medication from a Walmart. I was told over the phone that I could use something called Rx Express Pay and someone would bring me my medication out to my car once I called to let them know I was there. This was not the case. Once I called, I was told to park in one of the designated spaces for pharmacy pickup and then transferred to someone else who informed me they didn't have the scanner for pickup and that I would have to go inside.

This was shortly after masks or face coverings were recommended. It was on a Sunday and I was really shocked to see families going into the store and a lack of social distancing, but I needed my medication. Thankfully, I had a mask, gloves, and hand sanitizer in my car as emergency and went in.

At the entrance, there was a worker offering sanitized shopping carts and that's great, but it was holding up the queue where a guy shouts turns around and basically shouts to his wife but practically in my face, ""Do you want a shopping cart?!"" The social distancing markers weren't doing anything.

I took a quick look around to see the amount of people casually pushing their carts around without any protection. Couples, families, and this was the beginning of April in downstate New York! Our county has one of the highest infection rates outside the metro area.

The pharmacy had a safety shield in front of it and made the process rapid. They didn't ask for my I.D. as they normally do. They didn't say much at all, just scanned my phone, the cashier handed me my meds after interchanging gloves. So, the problem were the shoppers during the 4-5 minutes I spent in there.

Right before Easter, there's a message in our family group chat from my brother's girlfriend. ""I need an Easter dinner headcount"". I was fuming. I missed my family, absolutely. Most of all, my nephews. But I had to respectfully decline because I thought it was irresponsible, especially considering my stepmother is a phlebotomist who WAS tested negative earlier on, but she could have gotten it since then.

EVERYONE went, except my step-sister, who is an RN, and her husband. And understandably so. Her mother could certainly take a few pointers from her.

After that, I haven't really gone anywhere besides taking out the trash, getting the mail, and running into a 24-hour gas station/convenience store to grab some essentials but I was protected, I even wore my sunglasses again, didn't care how ridiculous I looked. Needed bread, and milk.

I've also used food delivery services for the convenience, but I request that they come and leave the food by my door. There's no direct contact.

The moment I decided this may not be allergies and anxiety was last Wednesday night when I was walking around, trying to get things done for the move. I would walk short distances and feel shortness of breath. It was chest tightness that I've kind of had all along but was chalking it up to those other things because I know how anxiety can manifest itself, especially now. I was also feeling very hot, and this cheap digital thermometer was constantly showing different temperatures, so I thought, OK, this thing is probably not accurate. I was also seeing white spots, kind of like before a migraine. I know that's not a symptom but that's something that was happening at the time and it's still been occurring.

I drive myself to the emergency room, which was more like a tent. Most of the experience was outside. It was a very strange thing. The medical looked tired but their bedside manner made me feel safe and like it was crucial that I was there and I was sitting there wondering if I was wasting their time because I was still on the fence of whether it could be allergies or anxiety.

They took my temperature, low grade fever. Blood pressure was high but that could have been white coat syndrome. I was anxious and didn't know what to expect. They pricked my finger, gave me a packet how to access patient portal, sent some prescriptions to my pharmacy (which is no longer Walmart) and told me to wait. So apparently, they were administering a 15-minute test.

I did wait for about an hour, but it was highly understandable. A doctor comes to me an explains that I'm positive for the virus and have COVID-19, but was minimal risk and should go back home, take the medications I was prescribed and self-quarantine. He also told me about how my family could get tested, how I should rest (on my stomach or side if I can and less on my back). The whole thing was very streamlined, and quick but now my biggest concern is my family. A lot of them haven't been taking this seriously enough.

But they've all been tested, received their results quicker than I imagined. Everyone is negative. Since I'm living in a condominium, the HoA made an announcement regarding testing for everyone in my building while keeping my privacy intact. I think this is the first time I was pleased with my HoA, even though I wouldn't have really been bothered by them knowing, but just about everyone in my building are kind people besides one or two.

So how did I, and only I (all my family have now been tested negative) contract the virus when I felt like I was being incredibly careful about everything? I don't know but I imagine that chest tightness I was mistaking for anxiety could mean I was infected for a while. There's a lot of irony in my experience.



How am I actually feeling- I am lucky to have a mild case of COVID 19. I'm even more lucky that I haven't spread it to my family. I can't recall the last time I had any flu, the last virus I had was norovirus in winter and THAT was brutal. But the only thing I can really compare it to is opiate withdrawal or even benzodiazepine withdrawal because I've experienced both of those and they both have mental and physical side symptoms when you stop them.

Trying to sleep at night is really similar to what I experienced with opiate withdrawal and that's been the only thing that was very sudden. Not being able to take a full, satisfying breath is a crappy feeling, there's aches and pains, again, really like opiate withdrawal. Hot showers tend to help and give you and overall feeling of cleanliness which I feel is important while you're sick.

I've been experiencing some tachycardia, where your heart beats faster than normal at times. This could be attributed to other medications I take, or anxiety which I suffer from.

A strange sensation I've been feeling are ""brain zaps"". And that's not a medical term because there's no medical term for it but if you've been on anti-depressant and maybe missed a dose, or had to come off, you probably know what I'm talking about. Those have been brutal and I've been on my anti-depressant so it's pretty strange that I've been getting them.

I still get those bright white lights like I experienced the night before going to the ER. They aren't followed by a migraine so that's another question mark.

All in all, this is the weirdest time of my life, I think this virus is weird, and I do worry that it can suddenly take a turn for the worst but I don't feel that terrible. I have monitor my fever (by the way, I found one of nephew's old ear thermometers from when he was a baby and I've been using that with MUCH more consistent results than this piece of crap electric one I bought on Amazon!)

It was recommended you don't take ibuprofen, but rather Tylenol to maintain a good temperature. I was told by one of the nurses at the ER that a low grade fever isn't necessarily a bad thing, it means your immune system is going into overdrive to kick the virus' ass but it's still important that it doesn't get out of hand.

The only thing that's really tough are nights. I struggle with sleeping. I wake up a lot when I do get to sleep but again, it's something I just have to ride out and my only option is stay vigilant until recovery.

&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;ve all been tested, received their results quicker than I imagined. Everyone is negative. Since I&amp;#39;m living in a condominium, the HoA made an announcement regarding testing for everyone in my building while keeping my privacy intact. I think this is the first time I was pleased with my HoA, even though I wouldn&amp;#39;t have really been bothered by them knowing, but just about everyone in my building are kind people besides one or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did I, and only I (all my family have now been tested negative) contract the virus when I felt like I was being incredibly careful about everything? I don&amp;#39;t know but I imagine that chest tightness I was mistaking for anxiety could mean I was infected for a while. There&amp;#39;s a lot of irony in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How am I actually feeling- I am lucky to have a mild case of COVID 19. I&amp;#39;m even more lucky that I haven&amp;#39;t spread it to my family. I can&amp;#39;t recall the last time I had any flu, the last virus I had was norovirus in winter and THAT was brutal. But the only thing I can really compare it to is opiate withdrawal or even benzodiazepine withdrawal because I&amp;#39;ve experienced both of those and they both have mental and physical side symptoms when you stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to sleep at night is really similar to what I experienced with opiate withdrawal and that&amp;#39;s been the only thing that was very sudden. Not being able to take a full, satisfying breath is a crappy feeling, there&amp;#39;s aches and pains, again, really like opiate withdrawal. Hot showers tend to help and give you and overall feeling of cleanliness which I feel is important while you&amp;#39;re sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been experiencing some tachycardia, where your heart beats faster than normal at times. This could be attributed to other medications I take, or anxiety which I suffer from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strange sensation I&amp;#39;ve been feeling are &amp;quot;brain zaps&amp;quot;. And that&amp;#39;s not a medical term because there&amp;#39;s no medical term for it but if you&amp;#39;ve been on anti-depressant and maybe missed a dose, or had to come off, you probably know what I&amp;#39;m talking about. Those have been brutal and I&amp;#39;ve been on my anti-depressant so it&amp;#39;s pretty strange that I&amp;#39;ve been getting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still get those bright white lights like I experienced the night before going to the ER. They aren&amp;#39;t followed by a migraine so that&amp;#39;s another question mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this is the weirdest time of my life, I think this virus is weird, and I do worry that it can suddenly take a turn for the worst but I don&amp;#39;t feel that terrible. I have monitor my fever (by the way, I found one of nephew&amp;#39;s old ear thermometers from when he was a baby and I&amp;#39;ve been using that with MUCH more consistent results than this piece of crap electric one I bought on Amazon!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was recommended you don&amp;#39;t take ibuprofen, but rather Tylenol to maintain a good temperature. I was told by one of the nurses at the ER that a low grade fever isn&amp;#39;t necessarily a bad thing, it means your immune system is going into overdrive to kick the virus&amp;#39; ass but it&amp;#39;s still important that it doesn&amp;#39;t get out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that&amp;#39;s really tough are nights. I struggle with sleeping. I wake up a lot when I do get to sleep but again, it&amp;#39;s something I just have to ride out and my only option is stay vigilant until recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to keep my post updated here.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, the needle has not moved much. Which, is positive that it has not worsened (knock on wood); but, on the negative side of it: I feel like if it were allergies or post-nasal drip, things would start feeling better by now. I don't know that I can ever recall having any sort of allergy or sinus issue that lingers along for weeks on end.

Here's what I have been doing: 

Started drinking OJ/taking Vitamin C every day. 

Drinking all beverages without ice. 

Started taking Zyrtec every day, just in case. Some days, it helps a lot. Some days, it doesn't. 

Sleeping on my stomach. I generally sleep on my side or back, so training myself to sleep on my stomach has been a day by day thing. 

Taken some steam showers with VapoShower

I've been monitoring my pulse rate, which has been pretty decent steadily, as compared with the rate at the doctor. 

I do still have a sore throat most days. It comes and goes. Breathing/chest tightness has been better; some days, with the Zyrtec, it seems to be completely gone. But, it comes and goes. Some days are better than others. I still have not had a fever or any super severe symptoms. Although, fever is sometimes a good thing, because it means the body is fighting infection. So, the no-fever is almost worrisome at this point. 

In the meantime, I also worry about my parents. My dad has had a slight cough. My mom has had more of a cough, diarrhea, and has been blowing her nose periodically. But, seeing these boards, I know how quickly things can escalate or turn around. So...I remain hopeful that IF we all have something, it will stay mild. 

As for me, I am on about day 21 since the sore throat showed up and day 17 since chest tightness. And maybe day 9-10 since breathing became a bit more labored. Most days, I do feel better than I did a week ago. (Again, knock on wood) But, it does feel like it's lasting a while. I'm looking forward to being past all of this, and even more, looking forward to my parents seeming out of the woods. 

I do wish that testing was 1) More available and 2) Easier. A cheek swab you could do yourself in your own car so to minimize contact with other people would be great.

,COVID19_support,"My mum went to Sainsbury's just to get some foodstuff. She came home and after a few days she was really sick. She had all the symptoms the fever, dry cough and sore throat. Also a really bad nose blocked. It was inevitable we were gonna get it. My dad said we should not go to hospital because we never know what we had caught could just be the common cold.

&amp;#x200B;

So we all had it for like a week and then we were fine. I mean we might take an anti-body test just to make sure but we are fine. My dad is kinda old (57) but he was the first to recover then me (14), my mum (47),  my brother (18) and then finally my sister (16). This really felt like Covid-19 and it was unlike anything we ever ha. My family have a history of high blood-pressure and diabetes so we were kinda worried.

&amp;#x200B;

But we are fine now. I just wanna know if there are any medical people out there who would know if what we had is covid or just something else. Here are is the EXACT information of what happened and our symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms:

Heavy dry cough (Every couple of minutes)

Fever (My temperature was above the recommended and felt like hell for ten days)

Sore throat (The soreness came and went and was more like a strong tickle I think)

Blocked nose (This was like its not even possible to breath, I tried holding my breath buy squeezing my nose and it went away in 4 days)

Headaches (Had a headache as well but it was only for 3 days but every time I moved my eyes it would hurt like hell)

&amp;#x200B;

Information:

I had it for 10 days

Dad had it for 8 days

Mum had it longest 13 days

Brother had it 12 days

Sister had it for shortest 6 days

My sister caught it last as she is studying for A-Level so stays in her room most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope someone out there can help us thanks!

&lt;p&gt;My sister caught it last as she is studying for A-Level so stays in her room most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone care to shed some insight? It is translated from German, but the doctor himself seems to self-contradict first saying it is irreversible damage and then saying: ""We don't know how much of the changes will last"".

I also don't quite understand how a truly mild case can cause lung-damage. In this article it says the case was not severe and treated at home. Is this, because there was no treatment and is it a moderate case with pneumonia rather than a true MILD case?

Would anyone with a science background care to chime in? Is it really possible to only have flu-like symptoms with no pneumonia and be scarred for life? Can this be different from SARS-1 even which seemed more severe of an illness (higher mortality rate)? SARS-1 saw lasting damage, but afaik most if not all did recover after 5 years. 5 years is terrifying but not a ""life-sentence"" for young active people, at least.

- I wake up in the mornings feeling hot in my face and clammy. I immediately assume its a fever. Check my temperature. Its 36.7 (98). Oh. Maybe not.

- I get a sniffly nose and sneezes and feel chilly. Immediately assume its the cold symptoms that people say comes first.

- I get an upset tummy and keep having to go to the toilet. I assume it's the stomach problems being say is a first warning sign.

- I've heard conjunctivitis symptoms are an early warning sign. So when my eyes feel a bit weird, I rub them to get rid of any crusty stuff. Then my eyes go a bit red. Hmm. I've heard bloodshot or pink eye is a sign too.

- I have an indoor exercise bike. I do between 5 and 7km a day, in about 13-14 minutes. No idea if thats a good pace or not, but it's where I'm at. One day, I'll do 7km in 14 minutes and the next, for some reason, I'll find it harder and only do 5km in the same time. I assume that's because my lungs are compromised by something. That's a bad sign too!

- I'm working from home, so I'm on video calls all day, speaking to people. By 5pm, I can feel my voice sounding croaky and hoarse and it hurts a little. The people who live with me can't hear anything different but I assume this is a sore throat and evidence that the virus is starting to take hold in the throat area.

- The upstairs of my house is reasonably cold, so when I jump in the shower, I sometimes get goosebumps. I assume this is because I must have a fever or body chills and not even a warm shower is helping!

- When I get into bed, I lie in an odd position and read my phone. My chin is almost touching my chest. I then start to feel a bit choky in my throat and a bit low on air. I assume this is because I'm lying flat now and I've read that lying flat makes your lungs work less efficiently and I've read that the virus is worse at nights when people lie down.

- I put on my humidifier in my bedroom and when I wake up in the mornings, I'm a little stuffy. I assume that the humidifier has been aerosolizing the virus in the steam and I've been breathing it in!


All of my assumptions can be answered by hay-fever, IBS, anxiety or just me being stupid.

I guess you can say I’ve been having a breakdown the last couple of days because of COVID. I was worried about my mortality and how getting the disease would be a death sentence for me because of my weight.

I’m calmer now, after an ambien’s night sleep and taking my prozac, but still very defeated, drained, exhausted what have you.

I’ll need to get groceries or have them delivered one day. When I have been getting groceries, I bring them in and put them on the counter, after taking them out of the plastic bags. I open the cabinet that holds the trash cans on the right side (the possible corona side; I’ll open it on the left side otherwise) and put the bags in there. 

Then I just leave the groceries on the counter, unless they need to be put in the refrigerator or freezer. I then wash my hands.

At the store I don’t use gloves, but I keep my distance. After leaving the grocery store, I use some hand sanitizer in my car. If some is provided for customer use in the store, I use that. I try to only open handles for store freezers with my pinky and then kinda go “Dr. Evil” as much as I can for the rest of my trip and not use it. 

I just don’t want to have to wipe down the groceries. I didn’t want to use the word “suicidal” in the title and possibly trigger someone. But is it suicidal to not want to wipe everything? I thought it may have been just like, laziness, as stupid as it is for that to be the reason. Is it the feeling of the wipes, maybe? The smell? The idea/fear that chemicals could somehow seep into the food?

Forgive my ranting on something so stupid. I think it’s my aversion to change in general that’s hitting me extra hard since this crisis requires a lot of change to deal with properly.

This virus is still so new (relatively) so it’s hard to know exactly what’s true in terms of how long it survives on surfaces. I could have sworn I read an article on some German scientist who tested commonly trafficked areas of his home and didn’t find virus or something like that. Maybe I dreamed it. Wouldn’t that be something?

,COVID19_support,"Hi. I apologize in advance for the long post, I just feel the need to express what’s been on my mind. I (25F) have had clinical depression off and on since 2010. I’ve been on a combination of medicines that works with me for about two years and I’ve been seeing a therapist at least once a month. But I recently came to the realization that my depression is back. I’m not sick with COVID-19 but my job deems me an essential worker (I’m a lab technician that tests consumable products) so I’ve been heading to the office everyday since stay-at-home orders have been in effect. We’ve been short-handed since mid-March so I’ve been doing the work of 2-3 people also. We hired a temp who started on Monday but because my supervisor works from home most of the time it is my responsibility to train the new hire. I didn’t realize my depression came back until my supervisor spoke with me (more than once) about being more focused at work. I attributed my lack of concentration, fatigue, irritability, and overall sadness to work stress/burnout. But on Friday I bawled my eyes out until 2am over being criticized at work, my lack of social outlets to utilize, and the fact that I basically feel trapped having nothing to do outside of work because of social distancing (I have hobbies but I’ve lost interest in them, another sign of depression). I woke up at 4:30pm today and basically told myself I can only move forward from here. I’m hoping I can bounce back from this, I’m hoping my depression is purely circumstantial, but at the same time I’m terrified that I’m going to be in a months-long depression once this is over.

,COVID19_support,"So this whole ridiculous saga started this past Wednesday. My mom, an oncologist (so in healthcare, but not front lines) came home complaining about some mild sniffles. She's been having really really terrible health anxiety and this sent her over the edge. She's been low key freaking out since she accidentally touched a doorknob at work and then touched her face. I don't think it's anything; it's been colder where I am and the symptoms she's describing are generally what I get when the temperature falls and the air gets dry. For caution's sake she wanted to sleep in the guest room (and has been doing so the past couple of nights), but this really sent my dad over the edge. He's bad at dealing with stress (he's been having trouble sleeping when she's not there and bad headaches) and told her that no, she couldn't do that. His position is that if she has symptoms, then she has no right to bring anything home and should just piss off to a hotel instead. So he's not letting her self-isolate at home. It came to a head this morning when he screamed at her and told her to get out of the house (like a clothes-throwing, screaming, red-in-the-face angry outburst) and she left to drive around...somewhere for like 5 hours. They've had big fights together and made up, but this feels completely irreparable. She eventually came home (because I kept telling her that Dad would want her back and he would be fine with her wearing a mask and gloves, which was...only partially true) but little has changed from this morning. Nobody has changed their basic positions. Mom has COVID-whatever, Dad is adamant that she gets far away from him if she has symptoms (he has hypertension and is on the wrong side of 50) She's now desperately looking for a hotel and I'm really really worried for her.

,COVID19_support,"Hi everyone. My partner and I have been taking this extremely seriously. I leave the house once a week for groceries but that's it besides a few socially distant walks. I sewed us masks for whenever we're outside. Part of the motivation is that my partner has asthma and I am very worried about how it would affect her if she were to get sick. Unfortunately her father who is a nursing home recently contracted the virus which has us generally more scared and taking it even more seriously than before.

Here's my dilemma: today we realized that our bathroom sink has a bad leak from from the pipe below. I don't think it would be that difficult to fix but we've tried ourselves and we're not able to. Obviously a sink is pretty important to have (the only other one is in our kitchen), but I don't feel super comfortable bringing someone into our home to fix it right now, especially because we rent our apartment and if we go through our landlord we won't have much control over who comes to fix it/won't know if they've been social distancing, etc. It's causing me a lot of stress.

As most of you probably relate with, I'm having some severe anxiety about the virus.

I want to protect them and my family desperately.

I've had very very little contact with the outside for the past couple weeks, only time I've left my house was today to go put air into my tire so it wouldn't deflate while I'm sitting here in quarantine, also went out to get a coffee for my mother and I to make her day a little better (obviously wore gloves and all of that). I practice perfect hygiene all the time in an attempt to minimize any chance of getting the virus.

However, about 30 minutes ago I had bad stomach pains, used the bathroom, washed my hands and decided to take my temperature since I've been super paranoid about that. Only made my anxiety worse because my temperature right now is hovering around 99.5-99.9 degrees and I don't know how to feel about this. I don't feel sick at all besides that stomach pain I had, now gone, I think it was because of some of the food I ate earlier.

,COVID19_support,"This paradise isnt purely manmade nor Mother Earth

A strange accumulation of both

Mother Earth has provided the body, the frame for us to build upon

Man has taken liberties to perserve and expand the beauty we have been given

And though Mother is no longer the original model,

 we have created something amazing

From high up, this creature has aspects of both

We combine Mother and Child

From up above roads are veins in the Her skin,

 slicing through the transparent covering

Freckled with trees, scarred with barren wastelands

We change Her skin like we change ours- paintings, piercings, cosmetics

And while some consider this sacrilege,
I consider it natural

The nature of humans is change: 

It makes sense we would change Her,
She changes Us.

Our relationship is complex, a tangled web that is hard to decipher and would be even harder to dissolve.

People say if Man were to disappear, Earth would take back all we had changed.

But when we lose someone, do we forget? 
Truly forget?

Can we erase our scars and marks that make us who we have been and where we have been?

I dont think she would be able to. 

Sure, she would evolve and change with the circumstances, but she won't forget. 

We will remain in Her memories

Our marks will not fade from her skin.

How do you breathe in for 5 seconds? I breathe in (I can hear that noise in my nose) and by about 3 seconds, it feels like I'm at capacity and there's no noise and I don't feel like I'm breathing in any more!

Holding for 5 is reasonably OK, I can do that.

Breathing out for 5 is a bit tricky too, unless I really breathe out slowly. If I breathe out normally, I'm done in about 2 seconds. The only way I can do it is by breathing out slowly through my mouth. Feels more like blowing out!

Unfortunately i'm a relapsed smoker and generally have a cough that comes and goes, but nothing serious. 

A few days ago I started having severe pain in my wrist, which I sprained months ago and was fully healed. After that I started to feel tired all of the time. Then I started getting GI symptoms. And then the body aches and cough kicked in, along with the strange dreams, burning eyes, chills and chest tightness. It's not severe (yet), but I feel like I have a bad flu, but...different. I did a video televist with my GP who i've known for the last fifteen years and he thinks I have it. And he set up a test on Tuesday. He is also my dad's GP and mentioned that even though my dad should be in horrible health due to years of not taking care of himself, smoking and working on vehicles as a career, he's always had a ridiculously strong immune system.  


And I think I may have gotten it from him, and that he's an asymptomatic carrier, as he is an essential worker, he still leaves the house daily. I'm 27 but currently living with my parents again after a fallout with a roommate before all of this started. My mom is sick too, but not nearly as badly as I am. I've taken every possible precaution, but I still most likely somehow have it. The only places I could have gotten it are from my dad or when I had an emergency and had to take my cat to the vet, but I wore a mask and gloves, never touched my face, etc. And that was less than a week ago.

I'm 27, i'm a (trying to quit) smoker, and I have anxiety derived heart palpitations frequently. 

Two of my friends had it but are on the mend, but I haven't had any physical contact with them since before this started. One of their fathers is clinging to life on a ventilator, though.

I've also never had pneumonia so I don't know what it feels like. Right now I feel like I have bronchitis.  


I'm also scared that if I am positive for it, I will have one of those cases that drags on for months, if it doesn't kill me. Those seem to be increasingly common.  


I'm horrified i'm going to die, or pass it on to someone else (i've been isolating in my room since this started), or having a case where I still have issues months down the line.

,COVID19_support,"Hi everyone,

I keep posting about my uncle (60s, diabetic), who has been suffering in the ICU for nearly a month now with COVID. He's developed heart, kidney, liver, and other organ issues due to the virus. I post about him when I get bad news and assume he's going to die - **which has been three times now**.

For three Tuesdays in a row, I've thought, *""This is it. I'm never going to see my uncle again.""* and every time, he somehow makes a small recovery and hangs in there. He's coded several times, had to have a pacemaker put in, has pneumonia, had his oxygen levels drop, and more. Every day, there is some new twist to this, some new thing that's reported. 

My aunt, god, I can't even *imagine* what this is doing to her. The latest update was from a palliative care doctor, telling her that if my uncle survives this, he'll have to eat and breathe through a tube and be put through extensive rehab. Thing is, the doctors have been wrong before - and last Saturday, he was awake, breathing on his own, talking, etc. They were going to have him Facetime my aunt but he coded on Easter. 

This is driving me absolutely insane. I've purchased grief books because even at 27, I have no idea how to deal with grief (I lost my grandfather a few years ago, but he'd been sick for a while and he was 97, so it was expected). I've bought children's grief books for my little cousins (grandkids of my uncle) because I'm so, so worried about them. I've listened to sad music, cried a *lot*, watched and played sad things, etc. Every time the phone rings, I listen for the sound of my mother sobbing, because that's what I woke up to once and I knew it was bad. I check with my parents and cousins at all times to see if there's any updates. I've been going *out of my mind* with the back-and-forth, good-and-bad. 

Basically, the doctors aren't consistent with their reports. There's like four different people saying different things, and I can't trust what they say. I've thought I lost my uncle three times now, and I'm mentally exhausted (along with the rest of my family).

Is anyone else having this kind of... holding-your-breath existence right now?

&lt;p&gt;This is driving me absolutely insane. I&amp;#39;ve purchased grief books because even at 27, I have no idea how to deal with grief (I lost my grandfather a few years ago, but he&amp;#39;d been sick for a while and he was 97, so it was expected). I&amp;#39;ve bought children&amp;#39;s grief books for my little cousins (grandkids of my uncle) because I&amp;#39;m so, so worried about them. I&amp;#39;ve listened to sad music, cried a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, watched and played sad things, etc. Every time the phone rings, I listen for the sound of my mother sobbing, because that&amp;#39;s what I woke up to once and I knew it was bad. I check with my parents and cousins at all times to see if there&amp;#39;s any updates. I&amp;#39;ve been going &lt;em&gt;out of my mind&lt;/em&gt; with the back-and-forth, good-and-bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the doctors aren&amp;#39;t consistent with their reports. There&amp;#39;s like four different people saying different things, and I can&amp;#39;t trust what they say. I&amp;#39;ve thought I lost my uncle three times now, and I&amp;#39;m mentally exhausted (along with the rest of my family).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is anyone else having this kind of... holding-your-breath existence right now? Where you keep receiving contradicting reports, can&amp;#39;t make posts/send messages too often updating everyone because it&amp;#39;s just changing so rapidly from good to bad and back again?&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"He’s 38, and he had a stroke on Easter Sunday. They actually found he had another stroke earlier last week, but didn’t realize it, and had another one in the past that they can’t date. So, three strokes all together. He suddenly got confused on Sunday, couldn’t answer questions, and was taken away in an ambulance by EMTs and police (after much arguing, because he didn’t think anything was wrong with him).

He’s a smoker, drinker, and drug user. They found cocaine in his system. My sister and I have been begging and fighting my parents to get him into treatment for 12 years. They did nothing, and here we are with a disaster on our hands in the middle of a pandemic. In central New Jersey, no less. 

He lives with my mother (70, cancer survivor with COPD) and his girlfriend, who is not a drug user but is just a complete airheaded idiot. My parents are divorced but we’re all very close. 

We obviously haven’t been able to visit him in the hospital, but we’ve been able to text and call him. He’s improved since Sunday; he remembers some things, but not others. He can pretty much answer questions, even if the answer is jumbled. 

He’s confusing words and having trouble with his short term memory. For instance, he insists he hasn’t seen a single doctor or therapist, but that’s not true. He can’t understand that he had a stroke or that his addictions brought it on, so nothing is going to stop him from going back to those behaviors except sheer force. Communication with the hospital has been horrendous, of course, because they’re a mess over there. 

He has no physical aftereffects, thank God. Just mixing up some words and unable to comprehend some very important information. He’s going to be released within a day or two and he’ll have to start speech therapy remotely. They can’t put him into inpatient therapy because those places are full, plus they’re full of Covid. We can’t send him straight to a detox because they’re all full. He has to come home.

He was in the ER for 6 hours Sunday night, not with suspected Covid patients, but the hospital has warned us that Covid is “all over the hospital” and he’ll need to self-isolate for 14 days when he’s home. He was tested for Covid upon arrival (negative) but will not be tested again upon discharge. 

I’m terrified for my mother, who will have to be the one to pick him up because the girlfriend doesn’t drive. I’m terrified he’ll come home and freak out when they try to stop him from smoking and drinking and drugging. I’m terrified my father will insist on going over there and thereby expose himself, and my mom will just allow it because she won’t be able to control my brother. 

I’m angry as hell at my brother and my parents. So so so angry, and it’s eating me up, although I’m trying to be patient with them all. My sister and I have husbands and 5 young children among us.

I also live with my parents- both 65 &amp; 75 respectively with underlying health conditions.

We have four employees, myself included. Two days ago one of my coworkers complained of allergies, and today she has shortness of breath and a dry cough. She went home &amp; is quarantining because it hit her heavily out of left field. 

If I stay home I will be out of a vital check and nothing much would change, I've already been exposed and potentially exposed my family. (Rarely, but still often enough. I decontaminate first &amp; wear masks when I do). Now I will completely cut myself off from any contact with them.

We spent the entire day decontaminating the office. She was tested today and I told them I may not come back to work until we have an answer for her. Being that our location is in the south with ""minimal"" cases, and even local authorities don't take it too seriously, I'm worried it could take her weeks to get a result. 

Should I continue coming to work as long as I have no symptoms, still sticking to my current routine of going to work &amp; straight home? Or should I completely stay home &amp; isolate.

I will not be influenced by my Manager's decision, but the office would shut down for the most part if I didn't come in for a week. 

I just don't know what to do with this level of responsibility on my shoulders. I want to protect my family but what's the difference between staying in bed for a week straight or going to work &amp; then straight home to my bed for a week and exercising extreme caution.

,COVID19_support,"I have anxiety/depression. I was also a mild germaphobe BEFORE all this. When the outbreak first started in the US, I was very nervous but reassured by my mother, a doctor, that I was not going to die if I did get this disease. I don't know how much of that was (non-malicious) ignorance on her part or if she was doing it just to calm me down. I am careful, I wash my hands often, like when I get home from work. I use hand sanitizer at work and I have it in the car for if I have to touch something like a key pad in a store.

There's no point in mincing words. I'm morbidly obese, but not bedridden/immobile. I can move, function like normal, take care of myself. I don't have heart issues, yet, but I was recently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes.

More and more I'm seeing articles about studies that show that the obese are at much higher risk for needing critical care. Now they're saying that some people who  are in critical care don't have ANY underlying conditions other than Obesity! And they're in their early 30s, like me.

This is definitely the wake-up call to end all wake-up calls, sure. I've tried off and on to lose weight. Could I do it via something like Intermittent Fasting, which from I've read looks promising for me? Possibly. But it's very unlikely to lose ALL the weight I would need to be healthy before a vaccine is made for COVID-19. I have a lot to lose.

So even if I start my weight loss journey again, I'll still be in a vulnerable group. Therein comes the feeling of defeat. I don't want to have to disinfect everything I buy from stores or have delivered to me. I don't want to have to put takeout food into the oven when I get it at home. Is that just laziness?

Short of going out in a hazmat suit, I can't eliminate all risk.

I feel like I'm going to just get the virus anyway, no matter what I do, and then go to the hospital and suffer, if not die. Maybe I kind of want to. Maybe they'll triage me for someone skinnier, which is fine. Better save them than me, pragmatically.

,COVID19_support,"I'm completely new to Reddit, so if there's a better place/other places I should be posting this, please let me know.

I have a rather difficult problem that needs a solution. My ninety-something-year-old grandfather is essentially sequestering himself in Miami (I live in another part of the country) while we wait for COVID-19 to blow over (whenever that will be); he can’t really leave his home. Right now his physical health is OK, but like many others, he is very bored, and I don’t want that to lead to depression. I love him very much, and while I recognize he could die suddenly in his old age, I would really like to see him again, and believe his mental health would be key to that happening. I also figure a lot of people are dealing with this sort of situation.

I’ve been trying to come up with activities for him, but there have been some challenges with thinking of something that would effectively engage him, especially since he is rather set in his ways (like many other older people). A number of things to consider:

* He used to be an accountant, so he’s very smart, and very logical, so I’m having trouble coming up with hobbies that he wouldn’t see as ""pointless;"" he’s not really a creative spirit (musically nor artistically).
* He has not-so-great eyesight, arthritis, and his skin/blood is very thin, so he can’t read books (about history and politics) like he used to (because his vision isn’t that sharp, and we don’t want to risk paper cuts). He can’t do jigsaw puzzles, because he can’t see that level of detail.
* He is hard of hearing, and while he speaks English fluently, he has a hard time understanding most people (and gets very impatient). Spanish is his first language. We’ve tried audiobooks and podcasts, but he keeps falling asleep while listening to them (which in turn affects his normal sleep schedule).
* We’ve tried Netflix; he hates movies and most TV shows, thinking they’re trash. He is famous for ADHD-surfing through TV channels, usually watching golf (or baseball, after my grandmother passed), or politics/the news, but he’s tired of watching sports replays, and the news is a downer nowadays. He’s gotten tired of watching Jeopardy replays.
* We’ve tried a Kindle and iPad; he’s not the most tech-savvy, and gets frustrated learning how to use them (e.g. finding books, changing the size of the display/font, etc.). He hasn’t even used a computer in years (his daughters handle his bills). So no online games like chess or checkers.
* My parents, aunts, and I call him everyday to chat, but he’s not a huge phone-talker. I’ve been trying to pick topics for stories he can tell about the past, but sometimes talking about people who died (including my grandmother, who died last year after 70+ years of being together) makes him very sad…so walking down memory lane with something like scrapbooking or recording himself talking isn't really an option.
* He never learned to cook (he grew up in a different era, and a nurse does that for him now) and he has no interest in learning now.
* We’re also trying to limit contact between him and the nurse as much as possible, so he can't play dominos, Chinese checkers, chess, etc. like he would with me when I see him.
* He is not going to get into birdwatching, knitting/crocheting, crossword puzzles, Sudoku, or stereotypical senior citizen activities (aside from certain games, but see above bullet point). He doesn't collect stuff like stamps or coins.
* He lives by a canal with alligators, so since he’s slow/feeble and old, having him go fishing or gardening out in the Miami heat isn’t ideal…so probably no activities that involve extensive periods outdoors. Would also have to avoid things that would attract insects/bugs/animals into the house.
* He's not a pet person, at all.
* He isn’t spry, so he can’t do more than shuffling around (so no yoga, spinning).
* He is religious, but praying can occupy only a certain amount of time.

I can order stuff for him online if your ideas require certain materials, so that’s not an issue.

I realize I outlined a difficult problem with a lot of parameters, but would appreciate any suggestions that would work, or if you could reach out to others asking for ideas…I figured a lot of elderly people are dealing with this right now, and thought this might be worth a shot!

&lt;li&gt;He used to be an accountant, so he’s very smart, and very logical, so I’m having trouble coming up with hobbies that he wouldn’t see as &amp;quot;pointless;&amp;quot; he’s not really a creative spirit (musically nor artistically).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He has not-so-great eyesight, arthritis, and his skin/blood is very thin, so he can’t read books (about history and politics) like he used to (because his vision isn’t that sharp, and we don’t want to risk paper cuts). He can’t do jigsaw puzzles, because he can’t see that level of detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is hard of hearing, and while he speaks English fluently, he has a hard time understanding most people (and gets very impatient). Spanish is his first language. We’ve tried audiobooks and podcasts, but he keeps falling asleep while listening to them (which in turn affects his normal sleep schedule).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ve tried Netflix; he hates movies and most TV shows, thinking they’re trash. He is famous for ADHD-surfing through TV channels, usually watching golf (or baseball, after my grandmother passed), or politics/the news, but he’s tired of watching sports replays, and the news is a downer nowadays. He’s gotten tired of watching Jeopardy replays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ve tried a Kindle and iPad; he’s not the most tech-savvy, and gets frustrated learning how to use them (e.g. finding books, changing the size of the display/font, etc.). He hasn’t even used a computer in years (his daughters handle his bills). So no online games like chess or checkers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My parents, aunts, and I call him everyday to chat, but he’s not a huge phone-talker. I’ve been trying to pick topics for stories he can tell about the past, but sometimes talking about people who died (including my grandmother, who died last year after 70+ years of being together) makes him very sad…so walking down memory lane with something like scrapbooking or recording himself talking isn&amp;#39;t really an option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He never learned to cook (he grew up in a different era, and a nurse does that for him now) and he has no interest in learning now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re also trying to limit contact between him and the nurse as much as possible, so he can&amp;#39;t play dominos, Chinese checkers, chess, etc. like he would with me when I see him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is not going to get into birdwatching, knitting/crocheting, crossword puzzles, Sudoku, or stereotypical senior citizen activities (aside from certain games, but see above bullet point). He doesn&amp;#39;t collect stuff like stamps or coins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He lives by a canal with alligators, so since he’s slow/feeble and old, having him go fishing or gardening out in the Miami heat isn’t ideal…so probably no activities that involve extensive periods outdoors. Would also have to avoid things that would attract insects/bugs/animals into the house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He&amp;#39;s not a pet person, at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He isn’t spry, so he can’t do more than shuffling around (so no yoga, spinning).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is religious, but praying can occupy only a certain amount of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can order stuff for him online if your ideas require certain materials, so that’s not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize I outlined a difficult problem with a lot of parameters, but would appreciate any suggestions that would work, or if you could reach out to others asking for ideas…I figured a lot of elderly people are dealing with this right now, and thought this might be worth a shot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"I've been experiencing COVID-19 symptoms for 16 days now, some of them things I've never experienced before (like fibromyalgia-type pain and purple sores on my toes). I'm fairly young (35), health-conscious and healthy overall, with the exception of minor chronic issues like mild asthma and allergies, so this many health concerns at one time are very new to me. I live alone, and wouldn't be interacting with anyone right now anyhow for fear of infecting them if I didn't, so all of this has felt very isolating and scary.

It has been comforting to me every time someone posts something to Facebook of a family experiencing experiencing symptoms, and some of them are similar to my unusual symptoms and that they have recovered or are starting to recover. One of my unusual symptoms is purple, painful, itchy sores on my feet, for example, which, upon developing them last Wednesday, I could find no connection to COVID-19 anywhere on the internet, and all my doctor could say was ""there's so much we don't know about this virus."" But yesterday a study out of Spain was published that showed pictures of my exact same foot sores, saying they'd been linked to coronavirus in patients in Italy, Spain, and France. Furthermore it stated that people whose sores looked much worse than mine had recovered without any scarring, even, which was very reassuring, since mine have been worsening and I'd been afraid my toes were going to need to be amputated or something!

I was wondering if maybe we could start a thread here for people who are sick right now (or have recently been sick) and have unusual, or perhaps even common symptoms of the virus, just to reassure other people who might have those same symptoms that this is normal and will go away when they're over it. (Even if you don't know what you have, since I know a lot of us, myself included, are unable to get tested). 

My symptoms started with a scratchy throat for a couple of days, then it got really painfully scratchy (for lack of a better way to describe-- it wasn't a traditional sore throat like you get with a cold, it just got scratchier and scratchier until it was so painful I couldn't sleep, even). On the third day of the scratchy throat, I lost my voice completely, developed a fever, chills, sweating, body aches, a painful cough and pain/tightness in my chest, and some shortness of breath, although that particular symptom worsened over the next few days. My fever stayed low-grade-- around 100.0, but never over 100.4 (which is one reason why I could not get tested in my location at the time). I felt like I had the flu for the first 3 days, then developed more cold-like symptoms-- a slight bit of chest congestion in the morning (but never really like when you get a productive cough from a chest cold) and on one day I had some nasal congestion (could've been allergies). I had a dull sinus headache throughout, although no other nasal symptoms for the first 5 days, except that one day (the 4th day, I think?) I lost my sense of smell almost completely for just a few hours. Throughout the first 6 days of my most intense symptoms, my eyes hurt so bad I was afraid I would go blind at one point, and I was coughing so hard there were a couple of times where I thought it was going to make me vomit. I had mild GI symptoms also-- major loss of appetite and nausea on the first day, less for the rest of the time, but diarrhea for the first 3 days as well, and still occasionally throughout the past 16 days. I have fatigue that comes and goes-- that feeling like when you've just had the flu and you don't feel like doing anything but lying down. The weird thing is that unlike when you've had the flu, I will feel it for an hour, and then it will go away completely for awhile, and then come back later. Kind of the same thing has been happening with the shortness of breath (although this could be from the virus triggering my asthma). One minute I can literally do 100 jumping jacks, the next I'm getting winded trying to fold laundry or wash dishes. After 16 days my respiratory symptoms are vastly improved (just the occasional coughing fit, but nearly no shortness of breath now), but about a week ago I developed new symptoms-- weird pain and tingling/buzzing in my legs and feet, and occasionally fingers. My foot was hurting after going for a walk, and I took off my sock to discover that most of my toes had turned slightly purple, and had dark red/purple round-ish sores on them. It kind of looks like mild frostbite, but it has been in the upper 60's, lower 70's where I live, so there's no way it's cold enough for frostbite, and I'd been indoors/in bed for the full week prior to developing this symptom, anyhow, so it's very odd. Finding the study linking this symptom with COVID was actually really reassuring because the other alternatives for this particular symptom are pretty scary!

I think that's about everything from my experience. Do you have symptoms or know someone who has symptoms or has tested positive? If so, could you please share what you know for those of us for whom this would very much ease the anxiety of what we're going through (and what we may have in store)? For me, at least, it's been difficult to get medical help due to high demand, and when I can get through to someone, they often have little advice because they haven't personally seen enough cases. The focus (for good reason) has been on people in severe respiratory distress, so I'd love it if people could share their more unusual symptoms and/or tales from their recovery :)",t2_4aebfepo,False,,0,False,A place to discuss symptoms?,[],r/COVID19_support,False,,,0,,False,t3_g2rsn0,False,dark,1.0,,restricted,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1587113694.0,text,,,,text,self.COVID19_support,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been experiencing COVID-19 symptoms for 16 days now, some of them things I&amp;#39;ve never experienced before (like fibromyalgia-type pain and purple sores on my toes).

I felt like I had the flu for the first 3 days, then developed more cold-like symptoms-- a slight bit of chest congestion in the morning (but never really like when you get a productive cough from a chest cold) and on one day I had some nasal congestion (could&amp;#39;ve been allergies). I had a dull sinus headache throughout, although no other nasal symptoms for the first 5 days, except that one day (the 4th day, I think?) I lost my sense of smell almost completely for just a few hours. Throughout the first 6 days of my most intense symptoms, my eyes hurt so bad I was afraid I would go blind at one point, and I was coughing so hard there were a couple of times where I thought it was going to make me vomit. I had mild GI symptoms also-- major loss of appetite and nausea on the first day, less for the rest of the time, but diarrhea for the first 3 days as well, and still occasionally throughout the past 16 days. I have fatigue that comes and goes-- that feeling like when you&amp;#39;ve just had the flu and you don&amp;#39;t feel like doing anything but lying down. The weird thing is that unlike when you&amp;#39;ve had the flu, I will feel it for an hour, and then it will go away completely for awhile, and then come back later. Kind of the same thing has been happening with the shortness of breath (although this could be from the virus triggering my asthma). One minute I can literally do 100 jumping jacks, the next I&amp;#39;m getting winded trying to fold laundry or wash dishes. After 16 days my respiratory symptoms are vastly improved (just the occasional coughing fit, but nearly no shortness of breath now), but about a week ago I developed new symptoms-- weird pain and tingling/buzzing in my legs and feet, and occasionally fingers. My foot was hurting after going for a walk, and I took off my sock to discover that most of my toes had turned slightly purple, and had dark red/purple round-ish sores on them. It kind of looks like mild frostbite, but it has been in the upper 60&amp;#39;s, lower 70&amp;#39;s where I live, so there&amp;#39;s no way it&amp;#39;s cold enough for frostbite, and I&amp;#39;d been indoors/in bed for the full week prior to developing this symptom, anyhow, so it&amp;#39;s very odd. Finding the study linking this symptom with COVID was actually really reassuring because the other alternatives for this particular symptom are pretty scary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#39;s about everything from my experience. Do you have symptoms or know someone who has symptoms or has tested positive? If so, could you please share what you know for those of us for whom this would very much ease the anxiety of what we&amp;#39;re going through (and what we may have in store)? For me, at least, it&amp;#39;s been difficult to get medical help due to high demand, and when I can get through to someone, they often have little advice because they haven&amp;#39;t personally seen enough cases. The focus (for good reason) has been on people in severe respiratory distress, so I&amp;#39;d love it if people could share their more unusual symptoms and/or tales from their recovery :)&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"We have both been in the house since March 16. We have once a day half hour walks and we never get close to anyone. We go grocery shopping twice a week and they've got a good system in place where we're always 2m away from anyone.

Our area (South West England) is one of the lowest hit areas in the country. Not many cases around here.

So, our chances seem low.

We've had no symptoms apart from mild hay-fever things like runny noses and sneezes when we're on our walks through the park and both of us have these symptoms every year anyway.

However, today, my girlfriend has woken up and she's very sneezy, sniffly, body aches, really tired (it's 11.15am and she's still in bed). She needed a paracetemol earlier and she says she has chills. She's freezing cold and I think it's quite warm in the house. She feels generally coldy and under the weather. She doesn't recognise this as normal hay-fever.

I know the advice is to drink lots, take medicine, hot showers etc whether it's just a cold or the virus.

But with her being 7 months pregnant, should I be doing anything else? Should we phone our GP just so he knows what's going on? Should she let her midwife know? She'd feel silly if it was just a cold but I don't know how we'd know for sure.

,COVID19_support,"Hello, everyone. I'll try to keep things simple so as not to over complicate things:

- Girlfriend went on holiday and 12 days later (24th March) she developed a fever, aches and an occasional tightness in the chest. She never coughed continuously, however. This sounds like corona, but we're not sure as testing isn't available yet.
- I last seen her on 18th of March but, strangely, have had no symptoms. 
- Girlfriend started to feel better on the 2nd of April and has been feeling normal since then. 
- We've been been isolating from others completely 

We want to try living together for a least 2 weeks. When, in your opinion, would it be safe to do so? The original guidelines in the UK were that you could leave self isolation 2 weeks after your first had symptoms, which would mean I could have seen her on the 7th of April. However, the WHO have also said you could still be contagious for another 2 weeks which would take us to the 21st of April.

I think I would be comfortable seeing her on a date past the 21st, say, the 25th or even pushing it to May the 1st to be extremely safe. Having said this, though, we've also read that the virus could be reactivating in people within 57 days.

,COVID19_support,"My husband delivers food to people's houses for his job. He's being very cautious and staying far away from all his customers, but he still has to go into public buildings most days to use bathrooms (he does wear a mask, but only a cotton one). And almost no one else who works for his company is taking things seriously - they're not social distancing (despite company rules). He sees those co-workers twice a week, plus alternates trucks with them. There's so many potential ways he could get infected.

Lately he's had a minor cough, and today he has a minor sore throat and feels achy in some areas. He's 29 and generally healthy, but when he gets sick, he usually gets quite a bit sicker than me. He's also a former smoker (switched to vaping 2 years ago, then quit vaping 6 months ago). And, he drank quite a bit over the weekend, then a medium amount on Monday and Tuesday. It makes me extra nervous since binge drinking lowers your immunity. 

(TRIGGER WARNING for this paragraph only - scary descriptions of cases) I've read so many stories of people being horribly sick for weeks and weeks at a time. Some people even just die suddenly at home apparently. And, the virus can affect your heart...last time he went to a doctor his heart seemed fine, but there are tons of severe heart issues that run in both sides of his family. His grandpa actually died of the virus last week...

I'm so terrified. He's my entire world and I would lose my mind if anything happened to him. I have severe anxiety about him dying suddenly already. It often makes me act irrationally. I don't know how I'd manage if he got sick. I'm also scared of course of getting the virus myself, and that my crazy anxiety for him would lower my immune system. I'm still overweight from my recent pregnancy too, which can apparently make things worse...

Speaking of pregnancy, to top it all off, we have a 6 month old - I'm scared of us getting so sick we can't take care of him (scared of him getting sick too of course, but not as much since babies seem to be mostly spared, miraculously)

Ugh. I've been nervous about this virus ever since Wuhan shut down, and have been obsessively wiping down our groceries, avoiding public places (we do grocery pickup), having us both take vitamins that help immunity, etc since mid February. I can usually keep my fear under control, but now the possibility of him being sick is making it all boil over again

,COVID19_support,"Every day, I keep on reading news about the virus. I try to balance my share of regular news with good news.

But I can't keep on pretending...

No matter how much good news I read, I can't take my mind off the truth. That the situation surrounding the virus is uncertain, the socio-economic impacts of the virus are unprecedented for this age, in some cases, nothing seen since World War II and the Great Depression.

I'm trying to look for the positives, trying to adapt my lifestyle, but I've come to notice that in doing so, millions will suffer even if they don't even contact COVID-19 because of the economy, because of the psychological impacts of social distancing, because of the uncertainty of the future, because of the fear that when you wake up in the morning, something so catastrophic could happen as to ruin your life. I'm trying to take my attention off the news, and I usually don't even read the news anyway, but this is something that could threaten the people I care about, again, even if they don't get COVID-19. Seeing how this will play out is important.

I usually track COVID-19 with [worldometers.info](https://worldometers.info), and I was cautiously optimistic over the past couple weeks as I felt comfortable knowing that new infections per day were slowing and eventually shrinking. Hopefully, this would eventually lead to an end of the pandemic, and we can all go back to normal.

But it's not that simple. In part due to inconsistent testing, essential workers at risk of the virus, people disobeying orders, etc., no matter the measures, things seem to be decreasing VERY slowly, and what I often find is that eventually, a spike of cases comes crushing any hope. For example, just recently in Spain, after a peak in March 26th, new cases per day shrank, and it looked like things would get better. the curve was flattening, and soon, the country could return to normal. However, just yesterday, the government reported ""NEVERMIND, ACTUALLY ABOUT 6,600 PEOPLE TURNED POSITIVE TODAY, SO NOTHING WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL"", and at that moment, it becomes clear that even with positive patterns, we can't even be sure of that due to the unpredictability of the virus, human behavior, testing, etc. The potential to even CONSIDER returning to normal seems like a far-off fantasy to me, as countries that looked like they were in the clear turned out not to be.

How about projections like the IHME's? I used to rely on that as a measure of how things would turn out. However, that proved to be dashed because of a change in reporting and announcements of new deaths that weren't even reported on. Now, their model has to be completely remodelled in the face of reality. Also, it seems too optimistic compared to reality. New cases and new deaths are decreasing much slower than they are increasing, suggesting that we'll have to be in this for a long time. Some scientists say it'll last until 2021 or 2022, and that's something I can't even bear.

I'm worried that the rest of society's problems may be aggravated because of this too. I know school shootings thankfully will temporarily be stopped, but what about terrorist attacks? I read in the news that ISIS was planning on carrying out terrorist attacks to take advantage of our focus on preventing COVID-19. Not only is that absolutely despicable, but it shows that we may have even more to worry about that is indirectly related to COVID-19? Not only that, but I also hear of the food supply being destroyed. Farmers are destroying their crops, warehouses are closing because of sick people. I'm worried if this eventually leads to a famine of some kind.

Will suicide rates increase because of COVID-19? Some people will grow so stressed they can't take it anymore.

This too has taken a big toll on my mental health. I'm not contemplating suicide or anything, but it's hard to be happy when reality is so bleak. This isn't something I can easily distract myself from. When I watch TV, when I watch YouTube, when I browse the freakin' App Store, I'm reminded that the world is fucked from COVID-19. It isn't as simple as turning off the news, because not only is COVID-19 everywhere, so is the news about it. Even opening up fucking Google reminds me ""by the way, coronavirus is killing thousands of people"". This has prevented me from completing my schoolwork, which I thought the one good thing was I could do my work from home, which I would've preferred. The problem is that not only does doing this work just remind of why I'm doing this, because of the fact thousands of people are dying, but also, my main way of coping with COVID-19 has been a distraction. I was easily distractible even before COVID-19, but this just aggravated it, as I suffer from information overload. Too much information in such a short time span is not something I cope well with, and I don't think most would disagree with that. Because of that, it has prevented me from completing my schoolwork. Not even my mother seems to understand that I'm suffering from so much anxiety that I can't even do my work. It has even led to a bit of hypochondria, the fear if I get coronavirus should I feel just a bit ill. My mother and step-father are both Uber drivers and would be the main carriers of COVID-19 in my household should anyone get it. It's especially scary for my mother since I know she has many health problems like Crohn's disease.

I just want a return to normal. I don't want to have to go through a crisis like I'm living in a third-world country in Africa with Ebola and West Nile Virus. There are some good things that have come from this pandemic. In my case, I would say for me it has been personal growth. This pandemic taught me a very important lesson on gratitude and taking things for granted. We take our modern world for granted, that everything we have will be there tomorrow when we wake up. Because of that, we've developed an unhealthy tendency to exploit the modern world, knowing that since everything will be there tomorrow, why should I worry if I""m messing with it? Well, this pandemic taught the truth, that NOT everything will be there tomorrow. We SHOULD be thankful for what we have, because if this pandemic can be a lesson the world needs, it's that everything you do is something you should thankful you are even able to do safely.

I've heard people talking positively about how this will destroy entire industries, and how that will be a good thing, because people will learn they were ""wasteful"". Not even actual wasteful industries that pollute and hurt people! Things like theme parks and movie theaters and restaurants, things that are just ways for people to have fun, but apparently they're ""wasteful"" now. And I'm glad that some people are getting a break out of this, if they are, but reading that kind of thing is making me so furious I honestly don't know how to cope with it. I loved the pace of my life before this. I loved my job. I liked going to the office every day,  I liked meeting my friends afterwards for drinks and going to the movies, and I even liked errands like going to the grocery store and getting my car fixed, now that I don't have them. I liked my ""unnecessary"" modern job that never could have existed in a world without technology. It all gave me a sense of accomplishment, the sense that I had plenty of things to do, and some of them were necessary and some of them were fun, but I was deeply, profoundly satisfied at the amount of busy I was. I was finally at a point in life where I had a job that kept me engaged but wasn't overwhelming, enough money to pay for basic necessities and a few carefully-budgeted luxuries I enjoyed, enough friends to have plans most weekends, and just enough of a life to be worth living. I had a busy life, but all the things keeping me busy were things that kept me happy. I was hopeful that we could build a sustainable, happy future that helped the environment and other people while still letting us keep the modern conveniences we loved. 

And now, that's all gone. The days just stretch on like some long formless void, with no structure and no change in routine. Everything is either boring or terrifying, and I don't even feel like I'm allowed to complain, since I'm financially fine at the moment and I at least have a safe place to isolate with some company. The life I had before this was not running me ragged or secretly untenable. It was \*good\*. I \*enjoyed it\*. I know that I am privileged because of that, and I acknowledge that, but my job was not actively hurting the environment or other people, and I refuse to apologize for being happy about it. I am not secretly happy that I don't have to go into the office. I am not actually discovering that it's more satisfying to cook than go to a restaurant. I am not and will never be the kind of person who enjoys retiring to raise sheep, and the fact that I'm somehow expected to have a miraculous vision that it was all bullshit because the modern world is corrupt or something is making me want to cry. I am not being gaslit or brainwashed by corporations or desperate to kill grandma for wanting to go ""back to normal"" and go to beaches and movie theaters and restaurants and theme parks again. I want to go back to normal because I *enjoyed* my normal. I know it's impossible to get back and we're probably losing a lot of these things anyway, but I want to grieve it without being told I should learn it was always secretly garbage. I feel like people have given up on the idea of improving the modern world so it's sustainable, and have become convinced that this virus is some secret cosmic lesson that we actually need to burn it all down and become farmers again.

,COVID19_support,"Just need to get this out somewhere. So, thanks in advance for listening/reading. My wife is really my only friend and I can’t keep burdening her with my unpredictable anxiety. 

I should also preface this by acknowledging that I’ve been pretty lucky so far in the pandemic, and in life in general, I suppose. No one I know directly has even been infected. My job is teaching online for a public university, so I was quite used to the whole concept of quarantine before it started. My wife is a journalist and can largely do her job remotely as well. Even as I write this I feel supremely guilty for struggling with all of this so much, especially when so many people are experiencing something far, far worse. 

I have such a crippling fear of the unknown in everything going on. As I’ve seen others mention here, my anxiety will swing wildly from feeling like I have a pretty good handle on things and feeling optimistic about the future to feeling like the walls are caving in and sobbing hysterically in bed. My university was already planning budget cuts (and likely faculty cuts) before the pandemic hit. Supposedly I’ll find out on Friday if I’ll be renewed for another year (I’m not tenure track) when the school budget is released. Pretty sure I’m safe on this round of cuts considering that I’ve been tasked with some large long term projects very recently, but it’s basically a given that enrollment will drop next fall. That’ll mean more cuts. My wife’s employer was also planning layoffs before the pandemic. You’d expect media outlets to be doing quite well right now given all of the traffic on getting news, but no one is buying ads since pretty much every company is in a financial crunch with the quarantine. We could probably get by with one of us losing a job, but the possibility of us both losing our jobs during the pandemic seems very, very real. 

We just bought our house a few years ago in a great neighborhood and our kid would’ve been finishing his first year of kindergarten in one of the best school districts in the state. Now I’m juggling my regular teaching load with teaching him, and he’s having some pretty bad behavioral problems adjusting to this insanity. I feel supremely guilty (and worry about the long term effects, like passing on my stupid anxiety to him) for snapping at him and/or having to leave him alone to play by himself for long stretches while my wife and I work, but we have so little time to actually do our jobs from home. So now that there’s talk of the fall semester being impacted as well, it seems like there’s no end in sight. 

I’d feel so much better about things if I had even the slightest bit of faith in the federal government’s ability to handle both the pandemic and the economic fallout. At the moment it just seems like they’re as rudderless as everyone else. I know every generation has to deal with some level of fear and uncertainty, but the whole world seems so incredibly more precarious now than it did last year. I should be happy.

I feel bad complaining when I’m in a very privileged position and most have it much worse than I do, but I need to vent. I am 20 years old and live at home with my parents and immunocompromised 15 year old brother. My dad is a doctor so we all have to social distance from him. 

He is sleeping in the studio apartment attached to our house and we have to try to stay six feet apart at all times. I miss being able to hug him and curl up on the couch and watch tv together.

,COVID19_support,"Hi Everyone - I developed a bit of a scratchy throat, dry cough and tightness in my chest yesterday. No fever or body aches yet, but I'm trying to figure out the best next steps to keep my family safe just in case. I am a new mom with a 7 week old baby and we live in a one bedroom along with my husband. With only one room, it's hard to isolate (unless I move into our garage which is possible, but has no heat). I am breast and formula feeding and my baby girl wants to be cuddling with me all the time. My husband is also an essential worker. So basically if I self isolate, he has to stop working completely (potentially losing his clients as he works for himself), I'll no longer be able to breast feed since I'm sure the supply I have left will dwindle and I would imagine this will be traumatic for our new baby at such an important stage in her life. Any thoughts on how to handle this?

I have been quarantined for 6 weeks now with our little one, but I went to a doctor's appointment last week and my husband could possibly be a carrier since he is still working.

No fever or body aches yet, but I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out the best next steps to keep my family safe just in case. I am a new mom with a 7 week old baby and we live in a one bedroom along with my husband. With only one room, it&amp;#39;s hard to isolate (unless I move into our garage which is possible, but has no heat). I am breast and formula feeding and my baby girl wants to be cuddling with me all the time. My husband is also an essential worker. So basically if I self isolate, he has to stop working completely (potentially losing his clients as he works for himself), I&amp;#39;ll no longer be able to breast feed since I&amp;#39;m sure the supply I have left will dwindle and I would imagine this will be traumatic for our new baby at such an important stage in her life. Any thoughts on how to handle this?&lt;/p&gt;

Like others have said, I totally appreciate the reasons and need for lockdown to save lives. It just happened to coincide with a really down period in my life. I love listening to music, it is my one true happiness and stress relief but since January, for as of yet unknown reasons I cannot use earphones or headphones without pain. Even after being treated for ear infections, the pain still happens. While I could use speakers, I even then still get some pain even on low volume, and I live with my parents who do not like hearing it. 

I was referred for ENT right before the lockdown which means my appointment is now in August. Meanwhile, I then got tinnitus in both ears and because there are no face to face appointments, I have no idea what is happening to me. I miss music so much it hurts. August feels ages away and I'm scared that I will just get worse to the point of no return by then.

I'm trying to do yoga and spend time downstairs with the TV on with parents to mask the tinnitus. Some days are better than others but just feels like a string of down days lately. Literally any other time I'd be able to cope with a lockdown by using earphones/headphones but now I can't and the worst is not knowing what is happening to me.

,COVID19_support,"I'm writing here because maybe someone else who has had this disease might be able to illuminate something about my present condition. 

I live in Edinburgh, Scotland in student accommodation...beginning on  Friday, the 31st of January, I started to feel very tired. By the next day, I had the usual symptoms of a cold: congestion, a mild cough with yellow phlegm, and a bit of a headache. I was not concerned at this stage, and I kept functioning largely as usual, even though I was a bit knackered. There were no documented Corona cases in the area at this time, but I live in student accommodation surrounded by students recently returned from China. I presumed I did not have Corona, because no cases were reported, I had no fever, and my cough was not 'persistent'.

These cold-like symptoms continued, but by following Friday, began to improve. My cough had disappeared. On Saturday, I was feeling mostly better, went out for a walk, did laundry that I'd been putting off whilst I was sick, and cleaned my room. That night I got hit like truck by new symptoms. My heart start racing, I had horrible aches and pains. I had night sweats where the whole bed became wet. I felt tightness in my upper chest. However, somehow, I was able to sleep. On Sunday, my symptoms lessened in the morning, but by night, they came back with a vengeance. I was up the whole night, my heart racing, with shortness of breath, nightsweats and aches and pains. I still had no fever. That morning on 10 February, as soon as I could I rushed to my GP, who conveniently has his surgery across the street from my flat. I had never experienced anything like this before, and I wanted to know what was going on. He took my blood pressure, it was high, but he said that was nothing to worry about. My heart rate was only slightly elevated. He said my lungs sounded fine, even though I was winded just by holding my breath as he used his stethoscope. Because I have a history of anxiety, he presumed I was having a panic attack or something like that related to my health, and that I'd just suffered a minor viral infection. He prescribed Propranolol. I never agreed with this anxiety diagnosis. As an 'anxiety-prone' person, I know the difference between anxiety and physical symptoms. However, because he said I was not 'in danger' of dying or anything like that, I went home. I rested, and my shortness of breath eased up a bit. My heart (combined with the upper chest area) still felt really odd, but not as bad as before. I took the Propranolol for two days, but it did nothing but give me cold feet, and I was certain it wasn't going to help. As the week went on, I rested, but was completely knackered, with horrible aches and pains and nightsweats. The shortness of breath did not return, but my upper chest was always achey and tight. On Thursday and Friday, I had stomach cramps. I also started to feel this strange 'bubbling' inside my chest, and a 'buzzing' inside my legs. This is one of the strangest symptoms I had. The buzzing is so bizarre...my legs are not shaking, or anything, but I just feel this internal 'buzzing'. In any case, I was continued on, still no fever, no cough. That weekend on Saturday-Sunday I had what felt like a relapse. Again, my heart started racing badly, I felt tightness in my chest. I didn't sleep at all Sunday-Monday, and again went to the doctor. I tried to explain that I'd never experienced an illness like this before. A cold never lasts this long, and a flu normally has a fever, and certainly it doesn't mess with your heart beat. He took my blood pressure and listened to my lungs. My BP was higher again, but not at a 'dangerous' level, and he said that was likely just a normal variation. My lungs he said sounded fine, and my heart rate was slightly elevated, but he said when he exercises at his age his heart beats faster than that. He tried to pinpoint where the pain in my chest was. He pushed under my breast area, and I found it very sore. He said this was an indication of muscleoskeletal pain, rather than a heart or lung issue. He said I just needed to go home and rest. So, I did. I rested for another week, and was able to sleep until the weekend again, though symptoms continued, when I had yet another relapse, though this time milder. I went to the GP again on Monday, and said, this is not getting better, it's clearly not normal...what's going on? And he said, I'll do a blood test and a ECG. I had those done. My ECG was normal, and this was a relief. Clearly whatever strange pain I was having, and my sometimes racing heart, were not going to kill me. My blood test showed slightly lower white blood count, and this was put down to the infection that I had had, but everything else was normal, except for slightly elevated bilirubin, which the doctor put down to gilbert's syndrome, because my other liver markers were fine. He ordered a followup blood test in a week's time. I continued to be extremely tired, aching allover, with strange pain in my chest, and buzzing inside me. But, the symptoms began to get milder. I thought I was getting better. When I had my next blood test, my white blood cell count had recovered. However, I continued to have bad and good days. By the 8th of March, however, I made close to a full recovery. I still had aches and pains, particularly in my upper chest, but by and large, I started getting back to normal.

Unfortunately, as I was getting better, the world itself started to get sick. Everything went into lockdown, etc. We all know what happened. I haven't exactly been enjoying these weeks on lockdown, but I was happy I wasn't sick anymore. I started to wonder, however, whether I had had an early case of Corona. In the early days, a fever and a persistent cough were required in order to be considered for corona, but we increasingly learned that for some people this was not the case. I had never experienced a sickness like that before, and I came to be certain that I had probably had a 'mild' case, the shortness of breath being the biggest hint. I was probably exposed from Chinese students returning after Christmas break. However, I was not able to be certain, and I took all precautions, staying inside and washing my hands.

However, starting this past Sunday, it seems like my symptoms have come back. On Sunday, I started to have a headache, and a bit of congestion. Then, on Monday, I had horrible headache and nausea. More importantly, the tightness and pain in my upper left chest returned. I had trouble sleeping again. While my headache somewhat recovered on Tuesday, on Tuesday into Wednesday I had the peak symptom of my previous illness...I couldn't sleep, with tightness and pain in my upper chest, and real shortness of breath. I could still breath, but it was painful, and I needed to focus on my breathing. I made it through that night, and here we are today. I still have no fever, no cough, but the tightness in my chest is bad. The shortness of breath comes and goes, but isn't as bad as it was last night. The buzzing in my legs and bubbling in my chest, which had been gone while I had been feeling better, came back. WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON?

Did I have Corona, and am I now relapsing? That's the best explanation I can come up with. I did not expect this, but I don't know what to do. I can call the doctor, but because I don't have a fever and a cough, I don't think he'll take me seriously, and in any case, only hospitalised people get tested in the UK now....I have no idea what to do.

&lt;p&gt;I live in Edinburgh, Scotland in student accommodation...beginning on  Friday, the 31st of January, I started to feel very tired. By the next day, I had the usual symptoms of a cold: congestion, a mild cough with yellow phlegm, and a bit of a headache. I was not concerned at this stage, and I kept functioning largely as usual, even though I was a bit knackered. There were no documented Corona cases in the area at this time, but I live in student accommodation surrounded by students recently returned from China. I presumed I did not have Corona, because no cases were reported, I had no fever, and my cough was not &amp;#39;persistent&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cold-like symptoms continued, but by following Friday, began to improve. My cough had disappeared. On Saturday, I was feeling mostly better, went out for a walk, did laundry that I&amp;#39;d been putting off whilst I was sick, and cleaned my room. That night I got hit like truck by new symptoms. My heart start racing, I had horrible aches and pains. I had night sweats where the whole bed became wet. I felt tightness in my upper chest. However, somehow, I was able to sleep. On Sunday, my symptoms lessened in the morning, but by night, they came back with a vengeance. I was up the whole night, my heart racing, with shortness of breath, nightsweats and aches and pains. I still had no fever. That morning on 10 February, as soon as I could I rushed to my GP, who conveniently has his surgery across the street from my flat. I had never experienced anything like this before, and I wanted to know what was going on. He took my blood pressure, it was high, but he said that was nothing to worry about. My heart rate was only slightly elevated. He said my lungs sounded fine, even though I was winded just by holding my breath as he used his stethoscope. Because I have a history of anxiety, he presumed I was having a panic attack or something like that related to my health, and that I&amp;#39;d just suffered a minor viral infection. He prescribed Propranolol. I never agreed with this anxiety diagnosis. As an &amp;#39;anxiety-prone&amp;#39; person, I know the difference between anxiety and physical symptoms. However, because he said I was not &amp;#39;in danger&amp;#39; of dying or anything like that, I went home. I rested, and my shortness of breath eased up a bit. My heart (combined with the upper chest area) still felt really odd, but not as bad as before. I took the Propranolol for two days, but it did nothing but give me cold feet, and I was certain it wasn&amp;#39;t going to help. As the week went on, I rested, but was completely knackered, with horrible aches and pains and nightsweats. The shortness of breath did not return, but my upper chest was always achey and tight.

My city is currently on lockdown. We are not allowed in parks or to cross provincial borders, no gathering of more than 5, everyone has to be at least 6ft apart. Washing hands, not leaving the house unless necessary (groceries, medication, doctors...)
I have two autoimmune diseases (so I’m on immune suppressants) as well as just finished cancer treatments under a year ago. So I’m very susceptible to getting sick with this virus. To make matters worse, I have lung problems due to improper intubation as a child.

She comes home casually and doesn’t wash her hands AT ALL (haven’t seen her wash her hands ONCE) doesn’t clean/disinfect anything.

My bar was already set pretty low for the general public, but I've been especially shocked by how so many loud voices on Instagram, YouTube and even Reddit are insisting that this is just a cold, that medical experts should not be trusted, and that we should open everything up immediately. As if hundreds of thousands of people suddenly dying isn't a big deal. They are so, so confident in their stupid opinions. It's not even just conspiracy theories, it's people acting like they know everything. None of these people care about any facts.

4 weeks ago I moved into my best friend's spare bedroom as an *isolation pact,* so we can keep each other company, combine resources (food, TP, etc), and self-isolate. Once a day we go out for a walk to keep sane around quiet side roads, observing social distancing and wearing masks.

1. Direct, sustained contact with someone suspected/presumed to have covid. 
2. Feel like I should quarantine, not just morally, but also to follow work guidelines

,COVID19_support,"Hello!   
I am trying to help educate my 82 year old mom on the following concepts related to COVID19:  
\--Any item brought in to the apartment from the outside must be treated with care (i.e. assume any such item could have the virus on it - and clean or 'quarantine' as appropriate).   
\--Any space outside the apartment (including elevators, laundry room, public hallways, mail area) must be avoided (and if can't be avoided...must assume the virus could be there and take proper precautions).  
\--Any human you encounter in person might be sick or be a carrier, or have the virus on their shoes or clothes, so keep them 6 feet away and out of the apartment (and definitely do not ask the FedEX delivery person to bring the box inside for you with the dolly - which she did).   
My mom is having a hard time embracing these ideas and adjusting her actions. I have tried the best I can to explain.   
I think if it were spelled out in this way (above) by a medical professional (and I emailed that info to her) she might start getting it. I have searched the CDC web site - but have not found wording that I think will help her get it.   
To summarize:

I have made a stock pile of masks that I've been giving out and stuff and she has one.

I'm currently living with my grandpa, so I wanted to know. 

She's been really upset lately, I can tell in her texts. I'm very worried about her and about our relationship. 

I want to be there for her and also keep myself, her, and my loved ones safe. 

My masks have three layers of cotton and are washable. I am planning to donate a whole lot to hospitals, police stations, and fire departments. I have already fitted my family with them and am trying to get some to friends. 

I have been depressed, as well, with not being able to see her and of course the stress of the pandemic, uncertainty about my future both career wise and, honestly, survival wise, and we also sustained some storm damage recently. I feel like the world, itself, is shitting on me.

Yes, I do have hobbies. No, I can't do them right now, even the indoors ones. I can't afford supplies and I couldn't get them anyway because the stores are closed. 

No one in my area is taking it seriously. No one is doing anything they've been asked to do. My snap is full of people at parties, drinking, and playing music. People don't social distance in public. Masks aren't popular, yet. No one uses hand sanitizer or washes their hands (from what they've told me). 

I am the only person I know literally torturing myself to do shit safely and it has greatly impacted my mental health in a super negative way. I'm scared of a lot of things. I am irrationally angry and I actually have come to hate people, now.

I can&amp;#39;t afford supplies and I couldn&amp;#39;t get them anyway because the stores are closed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one in my area is taking it seriously. No one is doing anything they&amp;#39;ve been asked to do. My snap is full of people at parties, drinking, and playing music. People don&amp;#39;t social distance in public. Masks aren&amp;#39;t popular, yet. No one uses hand sanitizer or washes their hands (from what they&amp;#39;ve told me). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the only person I know literally torturing myself to do shit safely and it has greatly impacted my mental health in a super negative way. I&amp;#39;m scared of a lot of things. I am irrationally angry and I actually have come to hate people, now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any comfort or help or whatever would be nice. I have nearly nothing left and I could end up with even less. And why would that be worth having? I hate my life right now. I&amp;#39;m so sad. I&amp;#39;m so angry. And I&amp;#39;m so, so, stressed out.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"Hello all. So up to this point I've been pretty calm about everything that's been going on. I worked as a server in a popular chain restaurant and we were basically furloughed around March 17th. The restaurant stayed open for takeout (which we have an entire job code that only does takeout). Originally they were offering hours to those who wanted them and I was happy to take time off work.

Since then I've pretty much isolated in the house. It seems to me that most people (at least in the US) are not taking this very seriously. People are out meeting friends, getting takeout food, and any business that can find a slight reason to be deemed essential is open. It seems more like people are looking for a work around.

Anyway my job called me today saying they had hours to offer me in our takeout position. I was asleep at the time. I had some coworkers that are working tell me our GM is going to report people to unemployment who decline the hours, which would either cut us off, and potentially mean we have to pay the money back. But the kicker is they don't have enough hours to support all the servers that they laid off, so it is my understanding that they picked a few people that they want to come work (because we're good workers) and are saying if we refuse they're gonna screw us. 

Now I feel like I'm an awful position for a variety of reasons. On one hand I understand that I am being offered work. On the other hand I barely consider it essential or life sustaining. In fact I hate that Togo even exist. I prefer not to use single use plastics.

And aside from concern for my own health and safety, my roomate works in a personal care home. I've been extra cautious so as not to put and entire building of elderly people at risk.

Basically I feel like I don't have a choice in the matter and the US is so determined to not let its already failing economy collapse that it'll find any work around it can so long as the numbers are good. And the sad thing is the economy doesn't even exist and is really just an idea, and no one understands that. These places of business will still stand at the end of this, people will still exist to work, and the product will be available.

And to top it off with our push to open the country back up , I feel like we're going to end up exactly where we were before because nothings really changed.

,COVID19_support,"Hi everyone, 

I have an issue here. My dad and I had a lengthy ""discussion"" (really a butting of heads) about how he does not want me to go to work anymore because of Covid19. But I disagree with him and feel the need to go to work because I have no choice as I'm working an essential job. I want to go to work as I feel like I shouldn't be held hostage to earn an income because of Covid19. I actually like working at my job and would rather do that for 10 hours a day currently than to stay under quarantine with my dad who has at this point basically become paranoid and panicky about the virus which he was not a few weeks prior despite only watching the news and not going into any further research at all about it until the US started seeing a spike in cases. He watches the news everyday (mostly CNN) and keeps track of the number of cases and deaths, minute by minute. I've told him that he should try not to follow the news so much especially at this time. But he won't listen so yeah. That's where the problem lies for me as I have not been paranoid or panicky this whole time and have tried to maintain a calm head in this whole situation, not only for myself but for everyone else in my family. 

I work in a warehouse with 8 to 10 other people and they've taken our temperatures everyday and have strict guidelines. I'm a fit, young healthy male in my 20s who exercises regularly and takes vitamin D every morning. I take precautions such as wearing a mask, hand washing everyday, etc. With that being said, I know I'm not immune to Covid but I think I'll be fine. 

He doesn't seem to understand that and is now saying I'm being ""selfish"" for still continuing to go to work. He doesn't understand that I've been taking precautions and looking at content from reputable sources like everyone else (which he knows I have and I was actually the first person in my family to start thinking about the impact Covid might have by buying the necessary supplies back in Early March and doing the initial research) when I take the bus. He says it's not ""enough"". I even mentioned I could get a coworker friend to drop me off to and from work before I start having enough money to get my own car. Not ""enough"" he says. Not only that but he has not taken into consideration that I can't just ""stay home"" like everyone else. I'm not a white collar office worker or a college/ grade school student so if I ever decide to quit my job because of that then I will not only be further behind financially and job wise but it will take me another 3 months to find another job after this lockdown is over and who knows when it will be. I don't ever want to do after having gone through that ordeal back in December 2019. Again, he's called me selfish and berated me for not caring about my two younger siblings despite me doing the research initially and basically consuming content from reputed sources (the news imo is not a reputable source and only feeds into the paranoia and fear. That's another story). He always seems to frame this into the ""greater good"" whenever I have my own personal interests at stake and says, oh well what about your youngest siblings or your mother or your family"". ""You're the oldest sibling here"". He don't really care about the impact this has for me, honestly. I don't want to quit and feel like quitting would be a ""I told you so"" moment for my parents and I refuse to do so as it will give me the strength to persevere through tough times as I have before. 

He's basically givien me an ultimatum if I decide to go back to work which is I should get my own ""room or hotel or Airbnb"" which is further confirmation he doesn't want me to go back to work. He knows I can't afford one at the moment and is using it as a scare tactic. He has a minor in psychology so I know what he's doing even if he tries to deny it. My mom is not off this too as she berated me also for going to work and said ""I don't go out much at all anyways"" so why should it be a problem for me to be in quarantine, she says. Again, she's said this nonsense before and I know exactly what she's trying to do here just like my dad. She works as a manager in a grocery store with far more people yet she wants me to quit when my little warehouse has a little over 8-10 people at any given time depending on which managers come in and out during the day. 

I'm honestly just tired of the BS and hypocrisy and self righteousness from my parents regarding this situation. I'm an adult and last time I checked, should be able to make decisions regarding my job without them having to play silly mind games and toying with the only stable source of income I have at the moment. I have a second source of income which can earn me enough in the future maybe more than the current job I have but I can't really do much with that one at the moment. Will they pay for my expenses (ie, phone bill, cable bill, credit card/college debt) once I quit my job. The answer to that is a big fat No so I think they should cool it a little bit.  

I can't do it anymore with the people in my personal life anymore especially my parents as I've become persona non grata in their eyes. Everytime I come home, I get stared at with contempt and have to constantly spray down everything from the outside including my shoes and other pieces of clothing. I get no praise or support for having to wake up at 4am every morning and work 10 hour shifts at my warehouse during such a time from my parents/family members. Nope, just beratment and constant guilt for working during this time as if I had a choice to do so. And then my dad has the nerve to ask me what I did with my tax refund for me to justify working during our ""discussion"" as if that has anything to do with anything. But again, I know what he's trying to do here. 

So I'm here to get a non judgmental assessment from people who aren't in my personal life about whether I should quit my ""essential job"" or stay at home like everyone else? I think about this disease everyday and it's impacts and did so way before it was talked about en-mass. I need an honest assessment and what I should do based on my current situation. 

Apologies if this was such a long post/vent but I needed to get this off my chest since last night. 

Thank You. 

Edit- I'm honestly afraid of being locked down at home with my dad and getting constantly lectured for not doing much in my life so far despite taking steps to do so. Also having my every move being watched. I'm afraid of being berated by mom for leaching off of her. I have too much pride for that which get from my dad's side. I also have depression and anxiety and I feel like that will make everything worse. I'm afraid of returning to the person I was 2 years ago.

Update- I've decided to stay at home. I literally could not sleep while trying to make this choice.

I'm the one that can (and has) function in multiple emergency situations, including serious injuries. I have always been the calm, stoic, methodical one in frantic situations. 

Lately, however, I am getting angry. Like, illogically angry. No patience. Constantly irritated. Sounds are setting me off. Certain topics are rubbing me the wrong way when discussed. Sometimes there appears to be no reason for the anger and frustration at all. It's just there and I'm struggling to shake it. 

I recognize the anger and have not taken it out on anyone or anything around me. I openly state that I need to disconnect for a second and physically remove myself from being around others for a quick break.

I'm still working. I'm 'essential', but not really. I'm in an office with 3 people. The rest are working from home. 

I feel like perhaps I've relied on structure too long. Logic for too long. Predictability and planning and the long-game.

I'm only essential because the people *at home* need me to be here in case I need to go into old records. 

But, I did work from home for a week and, yeah, needing paperwork and not having it *also* sucks. 

I literally don't know what to do. I'm so frustrated. I'm so angry. I'm an introvert so I'm not going stir-crazy, but I think this uncertainty is slowly chipping away at my patience.

My neighbours on the other hand have not been social distancing at all as far as I can see. They still have friends over, they’re CONSTANTLY fucking around on the street between our properties meaning any time someone from my house needs to leave they have to walk right past them. 

Their seven-year-old son has had covid symptoms for the past few days and they STILL allow him to play outside on the street. The other day I was coming back from walking my dog and the child came running down the driveway to pet him like he often did before this started.

,COVID19_support,"Like the title says, I need to go grocery shopping, and I had planned on going tomorrow morning as soon as the store opens. I have posted here before about my anxiety that I have dealt with before any of this started, but with everything going on now, it is just 10 times worse. I've been doing pretty well for the past couple weeks, as I haven't had to go anywhere. I have not been in a store since before the panic buying started, so that's also something that is going to be strange. I don't know how much the shopping experience has changed in the past month.

But, I am running low on some essentials and I have to just bite the bullet and go. I did delivery once, but they don't take my food card, and I can't really afford to grocery shop again not using my food card. Nowhere in my state accepts online ordering for food stamp cards. 

I found an old mask in my basement, really not sure on the quality but it is all I have. I was going to maybe wear a homemade cloth mask over it. I will be taking all the precautions, cleaning everything before it comes into the house, changing clothes, etc. I am also going to be leaving my son home alone for the first time ever since I think that would be better than taking him to the store. He is 9, and I definitely think he can handle it and we have talked about it (plus my duplex upstairs neighbor will be home in case of any emergency,) but I'm still nervous about that. 

I guess I just need someone to tell me that it's going to be fine, or talk me up, or something. I am kind of driving myself crazy right now, and I think I am almost more scared of having a panic attack at the store than I am of getting covid. 

Thanks for listening to me vent, any support is appreciated!

EDIT: First off, thank you all so much for the support!! Without you all this probably would have been much worse!

I am back from the store!!! I didn't have a panic attack!! I did feel very anxious a couple times, like on the verge of a panic attack, but with my own little exercises I was able to stave it off.

I feel so much better now that I did it. I stupidly forgot a couple items, but they weren't necessary right now, so I'm good with that. One thing I forgot was butter, but I should have enough to last a while if I try to use it sparingly. No baking with butter for me!

I didn't check my messages until I got home, and I see now that Walmart is accepting EBT food stamps online for store pickup! This is sooo awesome! I will definitely be using this the next time I have to get some groceries, but honestly for now, I am stocked up for about a month again (accept for milk because that only lasts 2 weeks.) I can't thank you all enough, it is almost bringing tears to my eyes right now with how awesome everyone here is.

I’ve been trying to write letters to my son &amp;amp; the rest of my family for when it happens. It’s super morbid. I’m young (24f) so I have that going for me but that’s about it. I’m in very poor health, lung-wise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just scared. I just don’t believe life can be decent, I know that sounds super angsty but it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"This may get jumbled. Just need to share.

I'm an emotionally intense person.  My depression and anxiety are increasing with each day of shelter-in-place.   I wish ""sucking it up"" were an option, or that reading, meditation and facetiming friends helped in a significant way.  But the truth is I wake up feeling an intense dread of the monotony and lack of touch awaiting me for that day and each one of the foreseeable future.   On the surface it's almost strange that something like simply being distanced from others and being forced to entertain one's self could do this to me. But there it is, tightness in my chest and a sense of deep sadness.   The fact that it's so indefinite probably contributes.             

I think this all has stirred up the latent feeling of disconnection / lack of community that American culture and capitalist realism create.   But now I have no remedy to access. No playing music with my bandmates.  No taking someone out on a date.      I have an almost resentful envy of those who are truly contented and pacified by things like watching movies, reading, cooking, and doing household projects for the sake of being ""productive"". That stuff could get me through a week or so.  After two or three, even strenuous exercise, writing and playing music feel empty and rather worthless.     

Turns out touch, face-to-face interaction, and simply the *potential* for new experiences with others are things I need to even begin to flourish.   I'm an ambiverted empath and putting around with my own thoughts isn't enough to feel like I am *really* living.       On paper, 40 or 50 days of hanging out by yourself seems tolerable- like one of those white collar prisons in Scandinavia, minus the co-workers. But somehow my heart and mind are going off the rails.      Oh and fuck, then there's the backdrop reality that even if this is a relatively short-lived, one-time pandemic, we are entering an era of such severe climate disruption that this is likely to look like child's play in hindsight.

While I was waiting for mod approval to post I also posted in r/anxiety but I'm very interested in this community's advice as well.

----

Some background: I'm in my 30's, diabetic, chronic depression and anxiety issues. My roommate has been living with me for 4 years. She's always been a little flakey but right now she owes me $1k. I'm not too stressed about it but it's kind of relevant. We share a small free-standing house, owned by me, with one bathroom.

Today I blew a gasket when she took a lyft to the grocery store. I have a car and have always been happy to drive her places as long as I was awake and available. I was awake and very available, I knew she was going to the grocery store and she told me which one and I told her the other one was much closer and nicer bc I assumed she was walking. But she didn't seem to mind and I thought she was just trying to get some steps in or something. 

My bedroom window was open and I just happened to hear the car pull up and looked out the window to see her get in. I was incensed.

1. How could someone CHOOSE to sit in an enclosed space with someone who has had who knows how many passengers over the duration of this pandemic. I was obviously available. Even in the driver sanitized after every ride, the driver was at the very least exposed to every passenger. I didn't ask if they were wearing a mask, but I know my roommate wasn't.



2. When she came home, I said I need you to change clothes because you were in a lyft, and she said but I just got home. I said, I'm immunocompromised and I need you to take everything that was in that car and treat it like your driver coughed on it. 



3. I have absolutely no understanding of why she did this, but she went to the grossest grocery store in town. When she told me she was going to the store I was like, oh we could probably use butter, then she told me which store and I was like, nvm I don't want their butter. It might make sense if she was trying to save money but then .. she took a lyft.. when there's a store in walking distance. I just don't get it on any level. There is almost no chance they are taking sufficient steps to prevent spread of the virus. It didn't seem like that big a deal before she left because that was before my trust in her common sense plummeted, and just thought I'd remind her to sanitize everything when she got home.


So the reason I'm posting this here is because I having been mulling this over for hours and I honestly don't know what the threat level is. How dangerous was that car ride? Personally I feel like I should consider her contaminated until she doesn't show symptoms for 2 weeks. Is it overkill? I have anxiety anyway but next to having a limb mangled, being intubated is my greatest fear and I'm tearing up just writing that. Also, is even possible to avoid cross contamination when we share a kitchen and bathroom? At this point the trust meter is leaning closer to suspicion than trust for me so I can't just trust her to clean where she's been. I think I would have to clean the bathroom and kitchen every time I used them.

I'm not completely without options, my parents are in Florida and their summer home is unoccupied in a town less than an hour away, but I have three cats and a dog, so it's an unappealing option to say the least.

I thank you for any advice you can give me. Dealing with a mental illness at times like this is so painful. Everything I've ever overthought, I could usually at least tell that I was overthinking it. It didn't help much but it was some comfort compared to this.",t2_6o1fi,False,,0,False,I need help finding the edge of my anxiety and reasonable fears regarding my roommates behavior.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support'}]",r/COVID19_support,False,,Support,0,,False,t3_g0dr3f,False,light,0.76,,restricted,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Support,False,2,,False,self,1586761089.0,,[],{},,True,,1586789453.0,richtext,,,,text,self.COVID19_support,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TW: Coronavirus&lt;/p&gt;

My 51 year old brother was admitted to the hospital Wednesday with the usual Covid symptoms. He seemed OK when he was there and it looked as though he just needed a little help beating this thing. He did not have any pre existing conditions.

His 02 levels were OK at the beginning, then this morning they went down to 52 percent, The doctors were able to get it back up to 65, but then he coded (heart stopped). They intubated him and apparently got his heart started again briefly, but it did not last and he passed away.

This post really wont accomplish anything for me personally, but I will pass on a little bit of advice. If you are a Black person as I am, Please take some Vitamin D supplements. Its been proven to help the immune system fight against respiratory diseases. Black people DO NOT generate enough vitamin D in many cases. Its strictly due to the melanin in the skin, etc.

Encourage people to stay home, the social distancing needs to happen. I don't want any of you to feel the pain our family is going through now.

Don't wait to go to the hospital if you are sick, please. I think my brother waited too long to go in.

,COVID19_support,"It feels like everyone on facebook has their story about how they ""had coronavirus in December"". No, your two week cough was not coronavirus. So many people on reddit, facebook, and instagram have stories about hoe ""mY fAmIlY Got SiCk In DecEmBer."" I'm sorry that happened, but it wasn't corona.

Coronavirus is highly infectious. If everyone your family had it, it would've been spreading a lot more. 

I know this is trivial, but it's so annoying to see so many people with the same story. If it was genuinely severe and it was sometime after mid January, then it's possible.  But no, your bad cough and fever after New Years wasn't corona.

Also this isn't really that deep, but I highly doubt that there's gonna be a baby boom like people keep saying. First of all, we're entering a huge recession. Second of all, if someone we're to get pregnant, they would have to wait quite a while to be able to go to the hospital for pre-natal check ups and other things of that nature. There's probably going to be a small spike 9 months from when quarantine started, but I feel that will be outweighed by the dramatic decline in births that will occur. The baby boom after ww2 happened because there was an economic boom which meant economic security. It was very easy for returning soldiers to buy homes and set up new lives, and of course have multiple children, which led to the baby boom.

After the pandemic is completely finished, and the economy begins to recover I think there could be a little baby boom, not on the level the 1950s, but could imagine the number of babies being born being higher than in 2019 or 2018. That would make perfect sense actually. However, this will take time. No one in their right mind is going to be having a baby right now. Unemployment could be as high as 32% because of this pandemic. There was a big drop in the number of babies born during the Great Depression, and it'll happen again. But just like the Great Depression, this'll be over one day. Brighter days are coming.

&lt;p&gt;I know this is trivial, but it&amp;#39;s so annoying to see so many people with the same story. If it was genuinely severe and it was sometime after mid January, then it&amp;#39;s possible.  But no, your bad cough and fever after New Years wasn&amp;#39;t corona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this isn&amp;#39;t really that deep, but I highly doubt that there&amp;#39;s gonna be a baby boom like people keep saying. First of all, we&amp;#39;re entering a huge recession. Second of all, if someone we&amp;#39;re to get pregnant, they would have to wait quite a while to be able to go to the hospital for pre-natal check ups and other things of that nature. There&amp;#39;s probably going to be a small spike 9 months from when quarantine started, but I feel that will be outweighed by the dramatic decline in births that will occur. The baby boom after ww2 happened because there was an economic boom which meant economic security. It was very easy for returning soldiers to buy homes and set up new lives, and of course have multiple children, which led to the baby boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic is completely finished, and the economy begins to recover I think there could be a little baby boom, not on the level the 1950s, but could imagine the number of babies being born being higher than in 2019 or 2018. That would make perfect sense actually. However, this will take time. No one in their right mind is going to be having a baby right now. Unemployment could be as high as 32% because of this pandemic. There was a big drop in the number of babies born during the Great Depression, and it&amp;#39;ll happen again. But just like the Great Depression, this&amp;#39;ll be over one day. Brighter days are coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know both of these rants aren&amp;#39;t very important and definitely aren&amp;#39;t as meaningful as other posts on this sub, but I just wanted to say this.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"Hi all, I apologize if this sub is not the right place for this post, I am pretty new to Reddit. Crossposted with r/relationship_advice.

I (27F) live in a 3-bedroom apartment in a suburb of a major city. I have two roommates, roommate A (37F) and roommate B (63F). I get along well with A but we have both had several issues with B over the past few months. B is a pretty careless person - not cleaning up after herself, leaving dishes and food all over the place, leaving windows open overnight in the winter, overloading the dishwasher so it doesn't run properly, and not listening when we ask her to do something/not do something. (Example: I have a cat who is on a strict diet and B kept giving her extra food, including table scraps, while I was at work. I asked B politely to stop probably 4 or 5 times.) We've also caught her smoking inside the house twice.

Myself and A are non-essential workers but B is a pharmacy worker. When my workplace closed on March 13, I came to the really difficult realization that it was not safe for me to stay in my apartment because B was out on the front lines working and she has never been careful about washing her hands or keeping things clean. I packed up my stuff and my cat and went to go stay with my mom (64F), who lives about an hour away. I have been at my mom's ever since. I did not tell B that she was the reason I was leaving. A also has had to stay elsewhere, but A did tell B that she was the reason. A and I have been in very sporadic contact with B, who has been saying that she is thinking about quitting her job at the pharmacy because she is at heightened risk for COVID-19 due to her age and her smoking. We asked B to keep us in the loop about her job status, since we both had to leave the apartment due to her job. On April 1, A went to the apartment briefly to pick up some stuff and B told A, after A had already been in the apartment for 20 minutes, that the pharmacy was closing for 4 days to do a deep clean because someone may have been exposed to COVID-19. A was furious at B for not telling her before she came in the house. (A did not drop by unannounced, B knew she was coming)

Today I was texting B about paying her share of a bill that is overdue (another issue, she is always late to reimburse us for utilities), and she mentioned in passing that she decided to retire and is no longer working at the pharmacy. I asked her how long it had been since she worked there and she said 5 days. I texted A and asked if she knew about this - A said this was the first she was hearing about it and she had talked to B two days ago. A is pissed because B knows that A is staying out of the apartment because of B's job. (I am also staying out for that reason and am frustrated with B, but I didn't tell B that she was the reason I left. I imagine that she figured as much but I'm not sure.)

I really don't know what to do next. In theory, B should do a strict 14-day quarantine and then A and I can come back to the apartment, but we don't trust B to 1. do it, or 2. tell us the truth about it. We are pissed at B for not telling us right away when she quit her job and we suspect that she may have put off telling us because she wants the place to herself. We all had to pay full rent for April so I'd really like to get back into my apartment as soon as I can, but I don't want to be unsafe. What can A and I do here? Should we go to the landlord? Will the landlord be able to do anything to help us? It seems impossible to ensure that B will quarantine herself, so I'm really at a loss.

Crossposted with &lt;a href=""/r/relationship_advice""&gt;r/relationship_advice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (27F) live in a 3-bedroom apartment in a suburb of a major city. I have two roommates, roommate A (37F) and roommate B (63F). I get along well with A but we have both had several issues with B over the past few months. B is a pretty careless person - not cleaning up after herself, leaving dishes and food all over the place, leaving windows open overnight in the winter, overloading the dishwasher so it doesn&amp;#39;t run properly, and not listening when we ask her to do something/not do something. (Example: I have a cat who is on a strict diet and B kept giving her extra food, including table scraps, while I was at work. I asked B politely to stop probably 4 or 5 times.) We&amp;#39;ve also caught her smoking inside the house twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myself and A are non-essential workers but B is a pharmacy worker. When my workplace closed on March 13, I came to the really difficult realization that it was not safe for me to stay in my apartment because B was out on the front lines working and she has never been careful about washing her hands or keeping things clean. I packed up my stuff and my cat and went to go stay with my mom (64F), who lives about an hour away. I have been at my mom&amp;#39;s ever since. I did not tell B that she was the reason I was leaving. A also has had to stay elsewhere, but A did tell B that she was the reason. A and I have been in very sporadic contact with B, who has been saying that she is thinking about quitting her job at the pharmacy because she is at heightened risk for COVID-19 due to her age and her smoking. We asked B to keep us in the loop about her job status, since we both had to leave the apartment due to her job. On April 1, A went to the apartment briefly to pick up some stuff and B told A, after A had already been in the apartment for 20 minutes, that the pharmacy was closing for 4 days to do a deep clean because someone may have been exposed to COVID-19. A was furious at B for not telling her before she came in the house. (A did not drop by unannounced, B knew she was coming)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was texting B about paying her share of a bill that is overdue (another issue, she is always late to reimburse us for utilities), and she mentioned in passing that she decided to retire and is no longer working at the pharmacy. I asked her how long it had been since she worked there and she said 5 days. I texted A and asked if she knew about this - A said this was the first she was hearing about it and she had talked to B two days ago. A is pissed because B knows that A is staying out of the apartment because of B&amp;#39;s job. (I am also staying out for that reason and am frustrated with B, but I didn&amp;#39;t tell B that she was the reason I left. I imagine that she figured as much but I&amp;#39;m not sure.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do next. In theory, B should do a strict 14-day quarantine and then A and I can come back to the apartment, but we don&amp;#39;t trust B to 1. do it, or 2. tell us the truth about it. We are pissed at B for not telling us right away when she quit her job and we suspect that she may have put off telling us because she wants the place to herself. We all had to pay full rent for April so I&amp;#39;d really like to get back into my apartment as soon as I can, but I don&amp;#39;t want to be unsafe. What can A and I do here? Should we go to the landlord? Will the landlord be able to do anything to help us? It seems impossible to ensure that B will quarantine herself, so I&amp;#39;m really at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"(sorry this is a bit long, i’ll include a tldr at the bottom but if someone could please help me feel calm itd mean the world)

i work at a restaurant. obviously not the kind of job you can work from home from. we’re following the city ordinances of take-out only, only one customer in the building at once who then must wait outside or in their car, curbside pickup thankfully online orders, door dash, uber eats, and postmates make up the majority but still...the dashers are coming inside, too. we have the entrance closed off so the customer can’t go more than a few feet in the store. so we’re doing everything we can without shutting down completely. 

but still. i didn’t even think about the little things, i was one of those people until like a week ago that thought it was “just a flu” and wouldn’t hurt me, but now i keep hearing about young, healthy people passing and im scared. it’s impossible to social distance from my coworkers, who seem unfazed by the whole thing honestly, my manger and i are the only ones wearing bandannas on our necks to pull up and no one else is wearing masks even though they’re saying you should now. and how am i supposed to trust that they’re social distancing otherwise?

i wash my hands literally like 2 times every 5 minutes or anytime i touch things like cash that could be contaminated, using my shoulder to push open doors, using a paper towel to open the door after i use the restroom. when i get home from work i put my clothes in the laundry bin, wash my hands before touching my face to take off my makeup and then showering. hot water. washing face and body 3 times. i wipe my phone with a clorox wipe. i take out my pizza out of the box and heat it (even though i’m probably the one who folded it). and i’ve been trying to wear my bandana at work but tbh it just stays on my neck most of the time (and so does my manager) because i feel like i’m being smothered. 

my mom has been getting our groceries and products  via target run so we’re not going to the grocery store anymore and target has everything. my dad works from home, my mom isn’t working, and my brother is in school online so i’m the only one who’s leaving the house most days. i’ve been trying to eat healthier and have less sugar, drinking airborne (great substitute for soda, btw) cuz it has vitamin c and has always shortened my colds (i heard the cold is a type of coronavirus?), i’ve also been taking vitamin d and nac long before the outbreak started which apparently have benefits. sleeping enough, going for walks in my neighborhood. i have two cigs left and i’m probably gonna try to quit them when i finish those cuz they’re saying they could worsen symptoms (not quitting the ganj though) and i only really drink socially so i’m not consuming alcohol right now. i have fairly severe adhd so i take adderall or else i’ll be a mess at work but i’m scared it weakens my immune system because i know mdma does which is also an amphetamine. 

i know that even if i contract the virus my chances of survival are high, as i’m a 19 year old, white, upper middle class female but i’m still scared i’ll be one of the mysteries in the news 

i really don’t want to quit my job. i love my job, i just got put in a higher position, and im one of the manager’s favorites/most trusted, and for the first time in my life i can say i’m proud of something. but this is all just really getting to me, sometimes i get hot and my chest hurts but it did that before because i suffer from panic disorder but i get scared it’s covid and then i panic more. 

am i overthinking all this?

,COVID19_support,"Hello all, first time posting here and I believe this is the proper subreddit to ask questions, so apologies if it’s not. Also, I’m on mobile so forgive me for any format/gramatical/spelling errors. Might be a long one. 

So I work at a drive thru in a Mexican restaurant, and I arrive home at around 11-12 depending on how long we take to close. Normally, my routine would be to remove my shoes at the door and put on my sandals, walk to my bedroom while making sure I don’t touch anything I don’t absolutely need to, removing my clothes and placing them in the dirty laundry bin so they can get washed when laundry day comes. I’ll wash my hands, clean my watch and phone, and take a shower, putting on fresh clean clothes after. To me it seemed logical, safe, and simple. 

Today, walking in, my dad didn’t like that procedure that I’ve been doing for the past couple of weeks. He told me to take my clothes off at the door so I can leave them outside and have them ‘cleaned’ by the wind, which should basically carry away the virus. Only then could i enter the house, out on a pair of shorts do I’m not in my boxers, and head to my room to take a shower.

I honestly find this somewhat bullshit, even though my dad’s been doing it for around two weeks as well. 

So I ask, what do you guys think? Is my method of leaving my clothes in the dirty laundry sufficient and safe enough or must I leave them in the wind for cleansing? Or perhaps there’s another, much safer and simpler alternative?

Also, I’m on mobile so forgive me for any format/gramatical/spelling errors. Might be a long one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I work at a drive thru in a Mexican restaurant, and I arrive home at around 11-12 depending on how long we take to close. Normally, my routine would be to remove my shoes at the door and put on my sandals, walk to my bedroom while making sure I don’t touch anything I don’t absolutely need to, removing my clothes and placing them in the dirty laundry bin so they can get washed when laundry day comes. I’ll wash my hands, clean my watch and phone, and take a shower, putting on fresh clean clothes after. To me it seemed logical, safe, and simple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, walking in, my dad didn’t like that procedure that I’ve been doing for the past couple of weeks. He told me to take my clothes off at the door so I can leave them outside and have them ‘cleaned’ by the wind, which should basically carry away the virus. Only then could i enter the house, out on a pair of shorts do I’m not in my boxers, and head to my room to take a shower. He tells me it’s so I don’t shake off the virus and contaminate my entire bedroom and the house, and it’s much safer having the wind blow off the virus than leaving it sitting in the dirty laundry. I honestly find this somewhat bullshit, even though my dad’s been doing it for around two weeks as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ask, what do you guys think? Is my method of leaving my clothes in the dirty laundry sufficient and safe enough or must I leave them in the wind for cleansing? Or perhaps there’s another, much safer and simpler alternative? &lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"I just want some opinions on how I’m handling things.

First, let me tell you a little about myself. I’m in my early 30’s, Type 2 diabetic (mostly well-controlled with insulin), and suffer from anxiety disorder &amp; OCD. A lot of my anxiety stems from medical-related issues. I’m married with three children—two school age and one toddler.

My children have been out of school since this started, and likely will be out for the rest of the school year (just waiting on an official announcement from the governor).
My husband is still working, in a precious metals Mine which has somehow been deemed “essential” (although, none of the resources mined are used in energy or anything important. Basically, this Mine makes a ton of money for our state so it’s more of a financial thing, than anything else). He is required to carpool to work, or ride a bus with 30+ people. Most of the people that work at the Mine are of the “it’s just a flu, put your big girl panties on” type of mindset. So they’re not interested in taking all the proper precautions to protect themselves &amp; others. My husband has been doing all he can to stay safe, even wearing a full-face respirator for most the day (this is always required in certain places within the Mine, but not in above ground offices and such). He hasn’t been wearing it while in the carpool, and the guys he rides with won’t wear masks or anything. 
Since he’s still working, and my health issue (diabetes) puts me at a higher risk for complications, he has been living in our RV. We’ve been lucky enough to have a few days with decent weather, so we were able to sit outside together and ride our bikes. Now it’s back to snowy, cold weather so that’s not an option. I hate being away from him, even though he’s only in the driveway. I know we’re doing this for my safety, and I appreciate him sacrificing his comfort for my well-being. But it sucks!! Are we being TOO careful? Since we don’t know how long this could last, it could be months before he’s able to safely come back in the house. I don’t even know how we can sustain this way of life for that long! Even when things get “better”, the threat will still be there. I just don’t know what to do. Tomorrow is Easter and he’ll have to spend it by himself in the RV, instead of being with me &amp; the kids. That breaks my heart.

,COVID19_support,"lately i've been following a lot of the developments about COVID19 and despite everything i feel mostly optimistic about the way this is going to be treated. it appears that the fatality rate is a lot lower than originally expected, herd immunity might be greater than originally thought, and antivirals, further testing, and vaccines seem well on the horizon (well, we probably won't get a vaccine until 2021-2022).

however though, i do wonder if my optimism about the situation comes from a place of naivety rather than what's realistically going to happen. it could be that i'm from a state that's been mostly pretty great at mitigating the spread (Washington), or that i've been lucky enough to not know anyone that's (officially) got coronavirus, let alone suffered the affects of it. my situation has made me feel isolated from how coronavirus has devasted communities around the world, and my optimism may come from a sense of being sheltered from how severe it actually is. 

i've looked at a lot of research and i have a degree of confidence that (at least where I am at) restrictions would gradually be lifted over the next few weeks, and that most things could go back to ""normal"" by the fall (well, nothing will ever be the same after this, but yknow what i mean). however, it feels like trump has been peddling a lot of the same rhetoric lately, and it seems like his strategy is to deny the severity of the spread and try to open up the economy again, which strikes me as EXTREMELY negligent. 

i'm not particularly an extrovert i would say, but i do really miss meeting friends and going to parks and restaurants and museums and concerts and even sports. i realize that these things aren't ultimately as important to society as preventing and saving lives, and obviously i prioritize saving lives over ""reopening the economy,"" but it's gonna REALLY suck seeing the death of public spaces and the possibility of many of my friends out of work for the next year or two due to the possibility of these not coming back until we have a vaccine (which i'm not expecting to fully roll out for a while). granted, we do have livestreams and online content to replace these at the moment, but it does not feel the same and will never feel like a true substitute. 

all in all, i'm just wondering that my optimism about the coronavirus situation comes from a desire to see people happy and carefree again, but that i'm in denial about how bad this could REALLY get, especially with the possibility of a second wave being even worse than the first. i'm trying to prepare for a worst-case scenario in order to cope with it, but the research says that we're making extremely steady progress on this, and even with the botched response and negligence with many public leaders we're still developing effective treatment against this virus to get things back to ""normal."" i guess what i'm looking for is reassurance, or a healthy tug back to reality over the possibility of longer-than-expected lockdowns and fully online classes and concerts until well into 2021. i'm working out on tuning out the Doomer mindset and trust the medical research on the frontline, but i think its justified to feel scared and afraid and wondering if that mindset should be more of what i'm prepared for (even though it's worse for my mental health). thanks!",t2_xq6ed,False,,0,False,is my optimism unrealistic and naive?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Questions'}]",r/COVID19_support,False,,Questions,0,,False,t3_fyyizb,False,light,0.95,,restricted,17,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Questions,False,17,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1586616924.0,richtext,,,,text,self.COVID19_support,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;lately i&amp;#39;ve been following a lot of the developments about COVID19 and despite everything i feel mostly optimistic about the way this is going to be treated. it appears that the fatality rate is a lot lower than originally expected, herd immunity might be greater than originally thought, and antivirals, further testing, and vaccines seem well on the horizon (well, we probably won&amp;#39;t get a vaccine until 2021-2022).&lt;/p&gt;

So.. my husband's plant has weaseled their way into getting deemed ""essential"" two days after our state issued a lock down on anyone but essential employees. They are absolutely not essential, but they said they provide resources to ambulances, and therefore are essential, despite the fact that almost everyone in their industry has a surplus they could send to ambulances (which can't be that many ambulances, considering how many plants make the same resource and have surpluses.. it's not a disposable product). The company has such a huge surplus that they were trying to decide what to do with the product prior to all this.

My state is currently nearing its peak for the virus, but the company doesn't care.

Hi, everyone! How are you?

I'd like to help at least some people out with withstanding quarantine. I've been noticing a lot more memes, posts, comments, and videos online which are focusing on the fact that a lot of people feel like they're being driven insane from the social distancing and quarantining.

I mean, anyone would! Being isolated in any way is difficult for any reason. Even without COVID-19 coming into the picture, it's damn hard to go for prolonged periods of time without the social contact which so many people crave.

Luckily though, I have been isolated (relatively speaking) my whole life; and especially within the past 2 years after having met my fiance, I have largely spent my life in self-isolation. I do my work and school at home, and I've only actually stepped outside maybe a third of the length of time between the start of our relationship and now... most of that was within the first year.

So in all honesty, when I started hearing about COVID-19, the idea that we'd be stuck indoors for the foreseeable future was not any change of pace for me, personally. It's something I've spent my whole life having to adapt to, but which now I fully embrace.

Unfortunately, a lot of the world doesn't have the luxury of experience, or the knowledge of how to survive while socially isolated. So, here are my tips and guidelines on surviving your social isolation/quarantine experience!

Here's what not to do.

1. **DON'T be unhealthy!** Again, this is something I've had trouble with. Rewarding yourself for 10 minutes on a treadmill - even an imaginary treadmill - by ordering Chipotle from Postmates is NOT the same as being healthy. Don't order as much fast food if you can help it. Home-cooked meals are always tastier, healthier, and more fun to make, too.
2. **DON'T be lazy!** Don't use excuses to justify your laziness. If you're telling yourself you can't learn, or you can't be active, or you can't wash your clothes and do the dishes despite being stuck inside all day because you're browsing reddit while having The Clone Wars Season 7 streaming in the background, then you're being a lazy dumbass. Turn off the TV, put down the phone, shut down your computer. Look around you. Look at yourself. What needs to be done? Do it.
3. **DON'T be selfish!** We're all in this thing together. Don't take more than you need in this time: food or water; time alone; breaks; entertainment; etc. Instead, use the time you have to use what you've got to put yourself at a point where you're at the very least stable, and then help others do the same. If and when you have excess, give it to someone who doesn't. If you've got extra cash, food, or clothes, give it to charity. Lots of people need that stuff during the pandemic, and lots more will need it after. If you've got excess time, comfort someone who needs it. Or teach someone who wants to learn a skill which you have. Just don't be selfish by keeping more than what you need.

Here's what to do!

1. **Stay active!** I myself need a lot of help with this, but staying active indoors is a big thing. A little bit of space goes a long way. So instead of using that part of the house where you usually pace as a spot of worrying and stress, turn it into a space where you don't have to do anything different, physically; but where your mental attitude affects whether or not this pacing is healthy. Because, yes, exercising while stressed does help relieve the stress, but if you're just pacing while focusing on your stress, then it doesn't help a whole lot. So if you can, maybe try doing some short-distant sprinting instead of pacing. Maybe combine it with squats, or lunges. Jumping jacks help. So do push-ups and crunches. A lot of Americans might be reading this and thinking, ""Wait, like PE we used to do in school?"" Yes, like PE. You were taught those basic exercises as a kid for a reason.
2. **Stay smart!** So, we're pretty much stuck indoors for who-knows-how-long. School may or may not be in session for a lot of us. If you're in high school or equivalent, I'm sure you might be attending your classes online. If you're a college/university student, I can see that ""might"" turning into a big ""maybe sometimes"" for a lot of you, haha. A lot of people aren't even in school, and haven't been for a while. And yeah, most of us don't like school, or are workers now. But that doesn't mean we have to distance ourselves from learning. So, take the time to learn, whether it be a formal class or not.

* How do you do this? There's a few different ways. Practically speaking, you're gonna want to start teaching yourself any basic skills you've been lacking in life. Not just cooking and cleaning, but also things like plumbing, repair, and basic machinery.
* More abstractly, you can teach yourself any other field you might find interesting. In my experience, school always sucked because it spent so many years forcing me into classes which were not taught effectively, until I was eventually told ""Now pick ONE of those subjects to focus on FOREVER or else YOU WILL BE POOR!"" Not fun. And I'm sure for a lot of you, it's the same way. But now, you have the freedom of the Internet to teach yourself the subjects YOU want to learn, at YOUR pace, with YOUR own way of practicing these skills at home. And you also have people online who have the time now to critique and help you succeed, just as you do too. So learn and teach, everyone!

1. **Look forward, backward, inside, and out!** This is a period where I think a lot of us feel like time is sort of wonky. So we might feel anxious about the present moment, and about the past, and the future, all at the same time; and at a much more intense level than we otherwise would be! But why? In my experience, it's because I never quite dedicated any time to think about my own life, and eventually had enough time on my hands that thinking about it was something I knew at some point I'd have to face. And that the refusal to face it, was what was causing my anxieties. So what I recommend you do is take some of the excess time you have each day to just sit down and... think.

* Look **forward**; plan out the goals and future you would like to accomplish. Not only once the threat of COVID-19 ends, but also while in isolation. Also plan out the steps you'll take to get there, and each part of those steps. Once you have a plan, start taking action. And remember that even if one step can't be done the way you planned, you can always change it to be more flexible while still working toward your goal.
* Look **backward**; reflect on your life choices. Ask yourself uncomfortable questions. We all know that the AITA subreddit is a place of external validation. But so is asking your family and friends if you've ever been the asshole of a given situation. Of course they'll usually say no. But if you ask yourself that. With the benefit of hindsight, put yourself in a ""fly on the wall"" mindset of past events where you might have been the asshole. Even if it was just to yourself. As painful as it is to admit, yes, we've all been assholes. So admit that you've been an asshole. BUT don't use it to pity or self-loathe. Examine why and how you were the asshole, and then going forward, avoid the mindset or circumstances that made you an asshole in the past.
* Look **inside**; Ask yourself who YOU are. What are your values? What are your morals? Can you make a list of values you hold dear? Or how you learned them and practice them? Do you use those values in a hypocritical way, by using them only when they benefit yourself? Or do you actively try and advance those same values for other people too? Yes, ***even and especially*** if it's going out of your way. Can you sum up your values into a single word? Can you sum up your moral code (how you live by those values for yourself and so that others can too) in three sentences? Don't stop thinking about this each day until you can. Also ask yourself if anything you're doing in your daily life causes you anxieties. Take this time to grow.
* Look **out**; Look around you. Take time to appreciate the life you do have. You have a roof over your head, food in the pantry, and clothes to wear. That's more than a lot of people could ever afford. Never mind anything else you've got. Appreciate how you got to where you are right now. It might not seem like heaven, but at least it isn't hell. So look around you at the world you know, and the things you have, and ask yourself questions like: Do I appreciate everything I have? Is this thing I have actually worth keeping, or would it be better elsewhere? Who helped me get the things I have? Who taught me important lessons which I can remind myself of with the stuff I have? And, don't be afraid to ""look out"" in the more common way. Look out for any potential dangers to your mental and physical health you're being exposed to, and try your best to fix the situations.

\---

Some people might be reading this and thinking, ""Whoa, look at this guy! He's using COVID-19 as a soapbox to tell us how to live our lives! You think you're so moral, buddy? Well FUCK YOU!"" If you're one of those people, I can't stop you from thinking that. And I wouldn't want to force you to change your mindset. Take it or leave it, it's your call.

Other people might read this and just ""get it"". Congratulations!

And some other people - I think maybe the majority of people - who read this are sort of in the middle. You might be confused as to how or why this weird post which talks about morality so much helps anyone with dealing with COVID-19. But a part of you thinks it does.

Well, if you're in that group, then I'll explain it to you. Does this post help with COVID-19? No. I never said it does! It's supposed to help you deal with the isolation we're all going through so you don't go insane.  And once COVID-19 is over and done with, then if you've taken this post to heart, you can keep using the skills you've learned and practiced to help others in their own situations - whether because of social isolation or not.

If you'd asked me a few years ago to read this post and answer the question, ""how can this help you, right now?"" Then I, as someone who was maybe between 19-21, wouldn't have been able to answer. But by learning to use my isolation to learn about myself, I learned to enjoy it. And from there, I learned to help other people. And from there, I learned how to enjoy life as much as I can, whether I'm by myself or with others.

And I hope that everyone who reads this, and who normally spends their time with others, and not enough time with themselves, uses this post to guide them. We're in a spot in life where a lot of us are just spending so much time by ourselves, indoors. Lots of people are feeling cooped-up because now they have to spend more time alone than otherwise.

Don't run away from the alone time. Embrace it. Learn about yourself. And then, when you CAN spend time with others, use this time you'd spent learning how to be a better person to make the enjoyment of life more fun for everyone involved.

&lt;p&gt;Hi, everyone! How are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to help at least some people out with withstanding quarantine. I&amp;#39;ve been noticing a lot more memes, posts, comments, and videos online which are focusing on the fact that a lot of people feel like they&amp;#39;re being driven insane from the social distancing and quarantining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, anyone would! Being isolated in any way is difficult for any reason. Even without COVID-19 coming into the picture, it&amp;#39;s damn hard to go for prolonged periods of time without the social contact which so many people crave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily though, I have been isolated (relatively speaking) my whole life; and especially within the past 2 years after having met my fiance, I have largely spent my life in self-isolation. I do my work and school at home, and I&amp;#39;ve only actually stepped outside maybe a third of the length of time between the start of our relationship and now... most of that was within the first year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in all honesty, when I started hearing about COVID-19, the idea that we&amp;#39;d be stuck indoors for the foreseeable future was not any change of pace for me, personally. It&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve spent my whole life having to adapt to, but which now I fully embrace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a lot of the world doesn&amp;#39;t have the luxury of experience, or the knowledge of how to survive while socially isolated. So, here are my tips and guidelines on surviving your social isolation/quarantine experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what not to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T be unhealthy!&lt;/strong&gt; Again, this is something I&amp;#39;ve had trouble with. Rewarding yourself for 10 minutes on a treadmill - even an imaginary treadmill - by ordering Chipotle from Postmates is NOT the same as being healthy. Don&amp;#39;t order as much fast food if you can help it. Home-cooked meals are always tastier, healthier, and more fun to make, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T be lazy!&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;#39;t use excuses to justify your laziness. If you&amp;#39;re telling yourself you can&amp;#39;t learn, or you can&amp;#39;t be active, or you can&amp;#39;t wash your clothes and do the dishes despite being stuck inside all day because you&amp;#39;re browsing reddit while having The Clone Wars Season 7 streaming in the background, then you&amp;#39;re being a lazy dumbass. Turn off the TV, put down the phone, shut down your computer. Look around you. Look at yourself. What needs to be done? Do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T be selfish!&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;re all in this thing together. Don&amp;#39;t take more than you need in this time: food or water; time alone; breaks; entertainment; etc. Instead, use the time you have to use what you&amp;#39;ve got to put yourself at a point where you&amp;#39;re at the very least stable, and then help others do the same. If and when you have excess, give it to someone who doesn&amp;#39;t. If you&amp;#39;ve got extra cash, food, or clothes, give it to charity. Lots of people need that stuff during the pandemic, and lots more will need it after. If you&amp;#39;ve got excess time, comfort someone who needs it. Or teach someone who wants to learn a skill which you have. Just don&amp;#39;t be selfish by keeping more than what you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay active!&lt;/strong&gt; I myself need a lot of help with this, but staying active indoors is a big thing. A little bit of space goes a long way. So instead of using that part of the house where you usually pace as a spot of worrying and stress, turn it into a space where you don&amp;#39;t have to do anything different, physically; but where your mental attitude affects whether or not this pacing is healthy. Because, yes, exercising while stressed does help relieve the stress, but if you&amp;#39;re just pacing while focusing on your stress, then it doesn&amp;#39;t help a whole lot. So if you can, maybe try doing some short-distant sprinting instead of pacing. Maybe combine it with squats, or lunges. Jumping jacks help. So do push-ups and crunches. A lot of Americans might be reading this and thinking, &amp;quot;Wait, like PE we used to do in school?&amp;quot; Yes, like PE. You were taught those basic exercises as a kid for a reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay smart!&lt;/strong&gt; So, we&amp;#39;re pretty much stuck indoors for who-knows-how-long. School may or may not be in session for a lot of us. If you&amp;#39;re in high school or equivalent, I&amp;#39;m sure you might be attending your classes online. If you&amp;#39;re a college/university student, I can see that &amp;quot;might&amp;quot; turning into a big &amp;quot;maybe sometimes&amp;quot; for a lot of you, haha. A lot of people aren&amp;#39;t even in school, and haven&amp;#39;t been for a while. And yeah, most of us don&amp;#39;t like school, or are workers now. But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean we have to distance ourselves from learning. So, take the time to learn, whether it be a formal class or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you do this? There&amp;#39;s a few different ways. Practically speaking, you&amp;#39;re gonna want to start teaching yourself any basic skills you&amp;#39;ve been lacking in life. Not just cooking and cleaning, but also things like plumbing, repair, and basic machinery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More abstractly, you can teach yourself any other field you might find interesting. In my experience, school always sucked because it spent so many years forcing me into classes which were not taught effectively, until I was eventually told &amp;quot;Now pick ONE of those subjects to focus on FOREVER or else YOU WILL BE POOR!&amp;quot; Not fun. And I&amp;#39;m sure for a lot of you, it&amp;#39;s the same way. But now, you have the freedom of the Internet to teach yourself the subjects YOU want to learn, at YOUR pace, with YOUR own way of practicing these skills at home. And you also have people online who have the time now to critique and help you succeed, just as you do too. So learn and teach, everyone!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look forward, backward, inside, and out!&lt;/strong&gt; This is a period where I think a lot of us feel like time is sort of wonky. So we might feel anxious about the present moment, and about the past, and the future, all at the same time; and at a much more intense level than we otherwise would be! But why? In my experience, it&amp;#39;s because I never quite dedicated any time to think about my own life, and eventually had enough time on my hands that thinking about it was something I knew at some point I&amp;#39;d have to face. And that the refusal to face it, was what was causing my anxieties. So what I recommend you do is take some of the excess time you have each day to just sit down and... think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look &lt;strong&gt;forward&lt;/strong&gt;; plan out the goals and future you would like to accomplish. Not only once the threat of COVID-19 ends, but also while in isolation. Also plan out the steps you&amp;#39;ll take to get there, and each part of those steps. Once you have a plan, start taking action.

,COVID19_support,"Hi, I wanted to throw down some links and personal advice for dealing with two things I'm very familiar with: sudden lifestyle changes (being mostly homebound due to shelter in place orders, based on my adjustment to being disabled), and managing anxiety (based on my experience managing anxiety).

First, a few awesome resources:

7cups is a website for emotional support. 

NAMI has this guide (nami.org/getattachment/About-NAMI/NAMI-News/2020/NAMI-Updates-on-the-Coronavirus/COVID-19-Updated-Guide-1.pdf), and there are some free resources on the headspace and calm apps.

I find that being distracted helps dealing with anxiety sometimes, so maybe watch movies or find free stuff via aidtable (https://aidtable.com/). Videogames can also be a good distraction tool, but if possible I encourage you to exercise as well, even if it's just a short Yoga with Adriene video or something.

Talkspace is probably the most popular online therapy provider, but https://moodgym.com.au/ offers FREE cognitive behavioral therapy and has been proven to be effective for some people.

I ""went"" to a lovely seminar today about anxiety and COVID-19, and the top recommendations were: CBT, getting exercise (including yoga), meditation and mindfulness, and setting a routine. I really recommend trying to implement one change at a time, and I think setting a routine is a good place to start. Try to wake up and go to sleep around the same time every day (even weekends), get dressed in the morning, eat at reasonable times, and set aside part of the day to not look at the computer and part of the day to walk/do yoga/move/exercise. Don't be hard on yourself if it's hard to start a routine--because it is hard! Try to make your routine reasonable (not planning on being hyper-productive 12 hours a day) and somewhat flexible.

In terms of help for the newly housebound, I found this resource really good: https://howtogeton.wordpress.com/newest-news-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/ Really, that entire blog is pretty great (though some might find some of the material stressful). https://howtogeton.wordpress.com/homebound-housebound-bedridden/ is good too!

In terms of self-care, California released this helpful tip sheet: https://covid19.ca.gov/img/wp/california-surgeon-general_stress-busting-playbook_draft-v2clean_ada-04072020.pdf

&lt;p&gt;First, a few awesome resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7cups is a website for emotional support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NAMI has this guide (nami.org/getattachment/About-NAMI/NAMI-News/2020/NAMI-Updates-on-the-Coronavirus/COVID-19-Updated-Guide-1.pdf), and there are some free resources on the headspace and calm apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that being distracted helps dealing with anxiety sometimes, so maybe watch movies or find free stuff via aidtable (&lt;a href=""https://aidtable.com/""&gt;https://aidtable.com/&lt;/a&gt;). Videogames can also be a good distraction tool, but if possible I encourage you to exercise as well, even if it&amp;#39;s just a short Yoga with Adriene video or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talkspace is probably the most popular online therapy provider, but &lt;a href=""https://moodgym.com.au/""&gt;https://moodgym.com.au/&lt;/a&gt; offers FREE cognitive behavioral therapy and has been proven to be effective for some people.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"I have people telling me, “it’s going to be fine”, “you’re going to be okay,” and I appreciate it, but I just find it hard to believe. I’ve always had this extreme fear that me or people I care about the most might contract some terrifying illness or disease and it’s been something that has caused a lot of panic and anxiety attacks over. People tell me because if my age, I’ll be fine. But I’m very overweight and I know people who are obese are at a much higher risk. Most of my family is overweight and this is what really scares me. I also keep hearing about young healthy people contracting it and getting severe cases. 

I look to my mom for some reassurance as she was a nurse for a few years. But she keeps saying it’s just like a flu. I asked her what her plan was and she said to just treat it like a flu.

,COVID19_support,"I work at a call center in Florida where I caption calls for the deaf or hard of hearing. My work doesn't have any way to work from home at this time, and they have stated that they won't be closing during the pandemic.

Things that they've changed since the outbreak started:

* Put signs around telling people to wash their hands after entering the building.
* Requiring employees to ""clean"" the timeclock after punching in/out with the same set of rags that all employees use all day to clean their cubicles.
* Encouraging employees to work in cubicles with one empty cube in between. This is not possible because of the high number of employees at my location. Even without the pandemic, there's often a line of people waiting for a cubicle to open up so we can work. We share computers and don't have our own assigned cubicles. The desks are probably 2 feet apart from each other.
* Started an emergency paid sick leave policy with up to 2 weeks of paid leave.

They also identified 2 employees who likely came into contact with that person and made them stay home for 2 weeks. They also stated that they've deep cleaned the call center since then.

I actually got sick about a week ago but have no way of knowing if it was COVID19 because I'm ineligible for a test (due to the test shortages, my age of 24, and my low risk of being severely ill).

I've been using paid sick leave days, but that's coming to an end and I'll need to go back. I have to keep going because I live alone and pay my own rent and bills.

37 Female 5'1, 230 lbs. Do not smoke, do not drink. Caucasian. No medications.

For the last week or so, I have had a sore throat on and off, and than over the last few days have developed some upper chest pain (similar to what you would feel with a chest cold) However, things seemed to be improving over the last couple of days. But, now, things seem to be getting worse again.

In the meantime, yesterday I had a Dr appointment, which was a follow up for a previous issue I had been having. That issue had cleared up and all was well. I told my Dr about the throat, but he did not visually see any issues. My oxygen saturation was 98%. My respiration rate was 18. My blood pressure was also well within normal as well. I've not had fever the whole time.

Is there any medication I should try to take? Claritin? Zyrtec? Should I be concerned in regards to Covid?

I would like to add that I woke up this morning, feeling like my throat is very closed. I woke up like a shot choking on something. I swallowed it back down, but it didn't really have a taste.

,COVID19_support,"Hi all, essential employee here. Today started out like any other normal day. I hit snooze way too many times, but 5am comes early! I was very sluggish this morning, but attributed it to my dog waking me up at 11pm last night because of a storm. While letting my dogs out, I started coughing, ended up gagging and throwing up. I decided to take my temperature as a precaution, only to realize I was running a low grade fever. I notified my job, and they advised me to take the day off.

As the day went on, I couldn’t shake the fever, and finally gave in and called a tale-health company my health insurance offers. After going over my symptoms they advised that I have mild Covid symptoms and would need to quarantine for 14 days. They told me to put a call in to my primary doctor to keep them in the loop. Upon doing such, I was told that because I was young and healthy I probably wouldn’t be tested. After going over my symptoms I was instructed that I needed to video chat with another doctor in their office that handles all possible Covid cases. I had my video chat, went over my symptoms again, but was told that unless my fever spikes or I start experiencing respiratory distress, I don’t qualify for testing.

My fever is staying the same (99.1), as well as most of my other symptoms. My chest has started hurting, but I think that’s from coughing. The only new symptoms I have are loss of taste/smells. I haven’t experienced a complete loss, everything just seems muted. Some things I can’t taste/smell at all, while others are faintly experienced.

Today started out like any other normal day. I hit snooze way too many times, but 5am comes early! I was very sluggish this morning, but attributed it to my dog waking me up at 11pm last night because of a storm. While letting my dogs out, I started coughing, ended up gagging and throwing up. I decided to take my temperature as a precaution, only to realize I was running a low grade fever. I notified my job, and they advised me to take the day off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the day went on, I couldn’t shake the fever, and finally gave in and called a tale-health company my health insurance offers. After going over my symptoms they advised that I have mild Covid symptoms and would need to quarantine for 14 days. They told me to put a call in to my primary doctor to keep them in the loop. Upon doing such, I was told that because I was young and healthy I probably wouldn’t be tested. After going over my symptoms I was instructed that I needed to video chat with another doctor in their office that handles all possible Covid cases. I had my video chat, went over my symptoms again, but was told that unless my fever spikes or I start experiencing respiratory distress, I don’t qualify for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fever is staying the same (99.1), as well as most of my other symptoms. My chest has started hurting, but I think that’s from coughing. The only new symptoms I have are loss of taste/smells. I haven’t experienced a complete loss, everything just seems muted. Some things I can’t taste/smell at all, while others are faintly experienced. All of this started this morning, 15 hours ago, and I’m just scared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a private person, so I haven’t told many people about this. The few people I have told, with the exception of my job, have been told not to say anything. I’m typically the person who comforts people and solves problems, I’m the strong one. I am so scared, but I also don’t want to worry those close to me.

,COVID19_support,"I'm just gonna dive right in, because today was rough.

I'm a US citizen, but I typically live overseas with my life partner. We are unmarried, but I was on the cusp of getting permanent residency. I've lived with him for 7 years. In early March, at the urging of my family, I came to visit NY to say goodbye to a dying grandparent (he passed a couple weeks after I got here). In the days after I landed, everything started closing down, borders included, my flight home was cancelled, and a trip that was meant to last a few weeks and staying with friends turned into a lockdown with my family.

I have OCD, anxiety and depression. I just started getting medicated for it this year. I've worked so hard on my mental health in the last couple years, and it's just taking a nose dive in the midst of all this. Unfortunately, my medication isn't available in the US, but I brought extra and didn't think I'd ever have to use up that much of it. Hopefully my partner will ship me more soon. I have a place to stay with my family, but my ability to do freelance work is limited, in part because my depression has intensified. I'm so tired. Every little symptom sets me off, and my health anxiety is skyrocketing. I don't get along with my family in large doses, and honestly, I had only anticipated staying with them for a couple weeks, going to visit close friends, and going home. Now I don't know if I'll even be let back into the country. I'm so afraid. I call my boyfriend every single day, but it's scary and hard.

I just want to cry, all the time. Even worse, my family has not been taking things seriously, and both my parents are higher risk and still leaving the house. We went to the funeral a week ago, and I wore a mask the whole time, but much of my extended family didn't, and were touching their phones, wiping tears, all that stuff... I wouldn't get near them or touch them. I must have looked really cold, but I'm really trying to stay as healthy as I can. I'm 30 years old, and around 8 months ago I got completely sober, I exercise regularly and I'm in general good health... but it's hard not to be scared. I'm so financially screwed on top of all of this, it's just hard. Some days I just wake up, roll over, and turn on Netflix. I've barely left my room because being around my other family members can be emotionally tough, but also scary, because they won't follow protocols.

I'm not sure there's much anyone can say. I feel like I'm in mourning, not just for the grandparent, but for everything and all the opportunities I'm missing this year in terms of career and life advancement. I'm really doing my best but it gets so hard and I feel utterly stranded. And I'm afraid. Really afraid. Being separated from my partner is a daily ache, and because I am not a citizen, I don't know if they will keep us separated for a long time. While I was prepared to take some time away from him and that was okay, not knowing how long I will be stuck here (especially in the damn epicenter of the US outbreak) has really thrown me into a dark place. I miss our home and all my things, my whole life is over an ocean and I'm scared of how long it will be to get back.

I hope everyone is feeling healthy today. And if you're quarantined with your significant other, give them an extra big hug today.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: My depression is getting worse.

The baiting and switching of everything is going to end me, mentally. I thought I was gonna get my meds in the mail. Now I might not get my meds in the mail. They don't make them in the US so I can't get them refilled here, and I'm too broke and too scared to switch my antidepressants.

It's been a good life. Except this part. This has been bad! I'm gonna do my best to hold on, but as it is I feel like a husk.

For years it has seemed like the world has been against him as he's dealt with being attacked several times in prison, having his family cut him off so I'm one of the only people he has to talk to, and dealing with several health issues. Despite all this, he has always been an outstanding father and done everything in his power to be a part of my life despite being locked away. He's a damn hero. 

I was a kid when he was put in, I'm now 22. We had plans to reintroduce him to the world and get him caught up with the things he has been missing. He is eligible for parole March next year. It might not seem that close to many, but relative to how long he has been in and dealing with the hell that is US correctional facilities, it is just around the corner. 

Just last night, he called to inform me he has tested positive for COVID-19. As he is a 48-year-old guy with type 2 diabetes and congestive heart failure, I've been hearing from a lot of sources that the odds are stacked against him. He called sounding like he was at death's door already.

They refused to test him even when he stated that he had a seriously high fever, was waking up in the middle of the night sweating profusely, had trouble breathing, and was having a severe cough. 

I do know that he has maintained a pretty decent diet and he has kept his diabetes in check quite well, since the only food available to him has made it really easy to do so. As for his heart, I'm not sure. I won't be able to check on him at all until he either recovers or we are hit with grim news since he is currently quarantined and unable to use the phone.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m concerned that she&amp;#39;s going to come out of this in poor health when there&amp;#39;s no need.  No sun, no walking more than a few lengths of the house a day, no fresh air  for 2-3 months can&amp;#39;t be good.  I&amp;#39;ve tried googling for some info on should seniors be staying active in these times, maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong.  But nothing good found.  It&amp;#39;s adding to my stress as her caregiver.  Actually role as caregiver is the source of most of my stress now a days.  My mind says she can make her own choices but I can&amp;#39;t stop my worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

 I live in Puerto Rico and the lockdown has been enforced very strict here since early March.

I haven't been allowed to go outside for any reason except to buy groceries, which we've always had delivered anyway.

I suffer chronic depression which I have only ever been able to manage with abundant rigorous exercise. I also really hate exercising.  It's taken me years to figure out a sustainable scheme to trick myself into taking the medicine I needed. It always involved a lot of external forces, CrossFit classes or running buddies or surfing or using a bicycle for all transportation. The last few months leading up to the lockdown I had finally reached a point where life felt worthwhile more often than not. After 15+ years of sludging I had a glimpse into why people bother being alive.

But now I haven't been allowed leave my apartment for over 3 weeks. Everyday I'm doing nothing but video games and Redditing and arguing on the internet and junk food.I have lost control. My relationship with my wife is crumbling before my eyes and I don't know how to regain control.

I know where this spiral gos. I know I need to do something, I just don't know what I can do.  Before I could always change my environment, I could distract myself with some outdoor hobby or goal. I could travel, I could mix things up. Now there's no where to go except jail or jump out the window.

By mindset, I am always someone who's focused on the ""Worst Case Scenario"", so right now I am pretty much seeing my life in permanent confinement, prohibited from going into work because I was infected and I am still a danger to society.

Many of you will disagree, but this is a conversation I hope we can consider.

1. Why can’t the immune deficient and the elderly stay home while the rest of us develop a herd immunity? Why isn’t voluntary isolation an option?

2. How many of you believe in a higher power/afterlife/reincarnation? If you or someone you know passes, is that the worst thing that could happen?

3. Have you considered all of the small businesses that have families that will not survive and then will be forced to obtain jobs from large corporations?

4. How many people will suffer from mental health problems as they file bankruptcy? How many will suffer from domestic abuse situations? How many will be unable to obtain other medical help due to these shutdowns? How many children will suffer in abusive households without their normal support systems?

5. How many times will they change their story and you will still buy into the fear?

6. If they roll out a vaccine for this, how many anti-vaxers will be in support of it? 🤯😳

,COVID19_support,"I am mostly making this post for anybody who has a loved one who is intubated in the ICU. Last night I was in the depths of despair because of how slow the progress has been since he was admitted to the hospital.

When he first started to get sick, neither of us assumed it was coronavirus. We were obviously very naiive and the fact that the severity of the virus was being so widely downplayed caused us not to immediately seek help. On this note, out of pure luck, nobody else whom we don’t live with has gotten sick or tested positive for the virus. Although I do feel guilty for not isolating him straight away. 

Once he started showing Covid symptoms we took him to the medical centre to get tested. The doctors were reluctant to test him at first because they said his symtoms were not severe enough but after his test results for flu 1 and 2 and strep came back negative they agreed to test for covid. this was two days after he started feeling unwell

we were instructed to self isolate and we adhered to this. a week later we had still not been given the result of his test and in that time his symptoms had progressed to the point where he was running a very high fever and his breathing had become very laboured. this is when his mom and I decided it was time to go to the hospital

Once he was admitted and after hours of waiting the doctor told us he was critically ill. They had intubated him and taken a chest x-ray which showed his lungs were full of pneumomia. This was the moment I first realised how sick he really was

Over the next 17 days he showed very little improvment. His ventilator settings were at FIO2 95 and PEEP 22 for the first 6 days then dropped to FIO2 65 and PEEP 19 for the subsequent 10 days

I was obviously very worried about what being on a ventilator for this long would do to his lungs. I also know that his odds of survival are not great. I spoke to an expert at the american lung association who told me that long term ventilation causes permanent scarring on the lungs and I lay in bed all night without sleeping terrified that his lungs were slowly turning to stone

this morning, as if by some miracle, his doctor called and told me he finally made an improvement. The hospital staff were able to reduce his ventilator settings to FIO2 40 and PEEP 15 with 31 breaths per minute. I realise that these are still quite high settings but at this point I’ll take what I can get. 

As for myself I have not been managing as well as I wish I could be. I am trying to stay “cautiously optimistic” as the doctors and nurses always say but it’s difficult. I cannot sleep without ambien and I’m using alcohol some nights in order to cope. What I really want to say to anybody in a similar situation to mine is this: 

KEEP YOUR SHIT TOGETHER. Your loved one is going to need you when they get out of hospital and you’ll be of no use to them if you’ve gone looney while they were in there.

,COVID19_support,"I was recently exposed to a co-worker who tested positive so now they are going to test me. I know it’s probably silly, but I’m having a lot of anxiety about the actual test process. I’m really afraid of the deep swab (I have a low pain tolerance), and also having people covered in suits and protection coming up to me like I’m dying. I don’t want to do it alone but I have to.

I was wondering if anyone who has had the test could explain in detail what it’s like so I know exactly what to expect. Or if anyone has any reassuring words that would be great.

Edit: I did it! Driving up to the tents was really scary tbh but the nurse that helped me was super nice. They did 8-second swabs in both nostrils. It was not pleasant, I would say yes it did hurt, but it was not as bad as I expected. I’m glad it was quick. I teared up from the nose sensation but also just from anxiety. My nose is a tiny bit sore now. But overall it is perfectly survivable, so if anyone who’s nervous about being tested sees this post, don’t worry! You can do it! If I can do it, anyone can. If I end up having to do it again ever, I would not be as worried because now I know it’s not that bad.

I guess fate would just so have it I have a different respiratory illness at the time of coronavirus.

,COVID19_support,"I see a lot of people that seem to think having an underlying condition means an immediate death sentence, or at least a severe case, if you get COVID-19 but that can't be true. Sure, an underlying condition will put you at higher risk of severe illness, but I don't think any condition will be an immediate severe case.

And I think the reason people feel like this is because most patients that do end up in the hospital have underlying conditions, but surely many of the non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms also have underlying conditions but they were never counted because they didn't end up in the hospital. 

What I'm saying is, we know the percentage of hospitalized patients that have underlying conditions (or at least a general idea), but we don't have the percentage of those with underlying conditions that are hospitalized or not. I'm sure there's a way to derive an estimate for this, but I haven't seen it talked about anywhere; I've only seen people talk about those hospitalized and their rates of underlying condition.

For example, assume that 1/3 Americans have hypertension. Now let's also assume that this ratio holds for those infected and 1/3 of people with COVID-19 have hypertension. So 100 cases, say 33 have hypertension.

,COVID19_support,"Hello, I don't know why I'm posting.  Part of me hopes that by venting I'll somehow be magically better and all this will go away.


Mom is a registered nurse.  For the last 15 years she served women in labor and delivery, high risk antepartum and women's health clinics.  She was my inspiration to go back to school and become a nurse myself.  I have been one for 13 years now.


Last week it was a mild fever, today she is intubated and fighting for her life.  Yesterday the ICU doc called me to ask if I still wanted her to have CPR.  He did not think it would help her if it came to it.  We took the calculated risk to transfer her to Hopkins, covid central her in MD.  He wasn't sure she was strong enough to make it there, but she did.  That's my mom!


She is retired but took a few shifts at a women's health clinic to make ends meet and help those women who spoke only Spanish.  She was barely strong enough for those 3 days a week, but she did it because she loved her patients.


I'm angry.  I want to blame her work.  They were/are still seeing patients.  One of there docs may have been sick, but I will never know the truth.  They wouldn't give out n95 masks to the nurses cause they weren't high risk.


I'm scared.  Not just that she may die.  I'm scared of interacting with people who selfishly lie about their symptoms to get non emergency things.  Some asshole who wanted her pap smear done right now may have lied to keep her appointment.  I hope it was worth my mom's health.  


I'm scared of my docs.  Afraid they may be doing the same.  Scheduling non emergent patient care and calling it urgent  to force it through the hospital doors.  


I'm scared of myself.  Scared that this is going to take away my ability to trust.  Steal my empathy and compassion.  Scared I would hesitate to do whats needed because of this.


I don't know whether this is helpful.  I don't know if I'm a broken nurse.  I just know I'm scared.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m scared of myself.  Scared that this is going to take away my ability to trust.  Steal my empathy and compassion.  Scared I would hesitate to do whats needed because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know whether this is helpful.  I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m a broken nurse.  I just know I&amp;#39;m scared.  &lt;/p&gt;

Our neighbors hosted a pool party last night. There are always cars at their house.

Sometimes I feel like I am not ""allowed"" to complain - I have savings, I can comfortably isolate at home albeit in a crowded neighbourhood of a large city and I have emotional support from friends and family online.

I am very grateful for this and yet I live in near-constant fear due to health and general anxiety. I am healthy, no pre-existing conditions (although I did vape for 3 years - quit a week ago) and young (20s). I have been self-isolating to the point that I am afraid to go for a walk and am terrified of buying groceries. I have been taking all the necessary/government recommended steps to protect myself when shopping.

I have also been having nasal congestion and a sore throat coming and going for almost three weeks and I am terrified. I have just gotten into a really good place in my life and now I am unable to even work out/focus on anything or go on walks out of fear.

I really don't know what to do. The other day I went out for groceries and sat down on my couch in the same clothes I went out in - now I am worried I spread Covid-19 all over my house by not changing my clothes right away (even though doctors only recommend changing clothes right away for workers in high-risk environments). 

I keep resetting the 14 day counter on my phone since I go out for groceries or to the bank and never feel safe as a result.

Today I have a moderate sore throat again and I am scared that I will be the unlikely under 30 statistic of a rare death or ICU case that leaves me with lung damage. I am afraid that all the opportunities I look forward to next year that I put in place before the pandemic will be cut short by this disease.

At the same time I feel terrible for ""complaining"" or worrying about myself when other people are so much worse off.

,COVID19_support," I think every community could benefit from easily recognizable universal signals for outbreaks or viruses.

I searched for it but there seems to not be a set of universally, recognizable signs outside of the bio-hazard sign which isn’t at all easy to draw. 

So I set out to create 3 symbols for : 

\- Immunocompromised 

o To hopefully create more awareness around that person or household

\- Recovered

o To give people a safe person to approach for help

\- Possibly infectious

o To warn people to stay away

I’m not an artist but I think I succeeded in creating easy to [draw](https://virussignal.com/draw) 

Set of symbols, you can see them on the website I made – [www.virussignal.com](http://www.virussignal.com/) or on the github [https://github.com/windows-user0/VirusSignal/tree/master/public](https://github.com/windows-user0/VirusSignal/tree/master/public)

I need your help to possibly improve the signs, improve the copy, translate, improve the website.

My mother is absolutely losing her mind with the stay at home order. She's always been a busybody: prior to this, she would work as a hostess at a fairly busy restaurant for 8 hours, and then either go to the gym or a greenway at a local park in the afternoon. For reference, she was easily hitting 17-21K steps a day on her Fitbit.

Since the stay at home order, she's been laid off, and most of the places she usually frequents have been (rightfully) closed. She still walks in the park every day (as of today, you're only allowed in by foot or bike, no cars) but due to prior health issues that worsen with the warmer weather, she's not sure how much longer she can do that anyway.

She's really not handling any of this well. She's already prone to anxiety and depression, and the added stress of the virus, losing her job, and having the whole family under one roof again is really, really hard for her; without her usual energy-expending outlets, she's been on the edge of a breakdown for a few weeks now. I think she also feels isolated because the rest of our family is handling it better (it still sucks, of course, but we're not as stir-crazy as she is).

I know that she understands and agrees with the fact that by staying inside, she's helping, but that knowledge isn't helping her stay sane in the same way it helps me. I have no idea what to say to her, or how to talk to her about all of this. I want to support her without coming across as condescending, or like I don't sympathize with her hopelessness.

,COVID19_support,"Just to give you as much information as possible, here are the main points:

* My sister (30) is an Internal Medicine specialist with a background on infectious diseases (such as AIDS, Malaria, etc). When everything started there were still a lot of patients with other diseases to take care of, so she wasn't called to the front line right away.
* She came by yesterday to ask me (26), my mom (58) or grandma (85), if we could shorten her new work pants (that she had to buy herself due to lack of proper material) because she doesn't have time to do it. She said she'll need it tomorrow morning at the latest because she'll start as a front liner tomorrow. It was a 2 minute talk at the distance. I had to collect and disinfect everything before going back to the house.
* More than 1 month and a half ago, when things started to get ugly in my country, my sister sent her husband (30) and 2 dogs to his parent's house. He has asthma and she was afraid to bring home the virus.
* My parents just finished a very messy divorce on February 17. My father (60) is a heavy ex-smoker who has had lungs issues since young. He lives with my grandfather (94). Both me and my sister haven't seen him in a long while.
* Me and my mother moved in with my grandma after the separation. We are not the healthiest bunch since my mother had breast cancer (and due to that has osteoporosis and a terrible immunity), I have asthmatic bronchitis and my grandmother has had both kidney and breast cancer and also has chronic bronchitis (and osteoporosis and low immunity)
* 1 week ago my mother fell of the stairs and hit her face, back, breasts, knee, hip, hands. She can barely walk and is very swollen everywhere. My mother is much better now, but it was a very stressful and bloody situation.  My sister was very worried but she couldn't do anything to help her.
* Before this all happened, my sister found out she had some infertility problems. She was in the middle of her third insemination attempt when this happened. She had to stop the hormonal treatments abruptly.
* She has been living alone, unable to see her husband, dogs, parents, grandparents, sister, etc for almost 2 months. She has no time to rest or take care of herself. She is not eating or sleeping well.
* My therapist is in maternity leave so I don't know who to talk to about this. My BF is very lost, my mother is a walking mess, my grandmother is always crying and praying and my father just prays and tells me to ask God for guidance.
* Nothing has been easy for our family and the rest of the world, but all can think right is how she's:
   * Extra Hormonal
   * Lonely
   * Overworked
   * Tired
   * Stressed
   * Unmotivated
   * Overwhelmed
   * Sad
   * Scared
   * Anxious
   * In danger
   * Unhealthy
   * ""Feeling like her life stopped and she's losing too much time in her private life"" (said by her)

I don't how to help. Even if I wanted, I have nowhere else to live. If I try to help her the only way I know how, I might be endangering  my mother and grandmother.

**I know that right now my sister has a bigger role in the world and that she has to sacrifice herself for the rest of us, but she is still my sister. I want her to be a mother, to spend time with her husband and dogs, to have a nice vacation, to sleep and eat properly, to be healthy and happy.**

**How can I help someone who is fighting a battle that I can only hide from?**

Any suggestions are much appreciated.

Thank you

,COVID19_support,"Hey everyone, I've been following this sub for a while now and it's been really helping me to follow people with similar anxieties as mine's and the responses, and I wanna firstly thank everyone for taking the time of the day to help eachother and provide some hope- it's really amazing and heartening.

These past days I've been having a bad relapse- I'm 18 years old and currently doing a semester in a small, independent language school in Munich, Germany to learn German. This opportunity came as a scholarship by a very, very kind patron of my family. I was over the moon about it, and had been for January and February. I love this city a lot. I loved going to school, learning german, meeting people and drinking little coffees after class.

But of course things hit the fan hard. The quarantine in Bavaria is quite strict and though Germany has been on a case slowdown Bavaria is not doing so hot.

The cabin fever and isolation has been really destroying me. I think of my mom and dad and begin to cry. I think of memories of school and Munich and begin to cry harder. 

Going back to Mexico is absolutely not an option. My family is not wealthy and it would be a massive cost loss to book a plane back; I would lose my weeks in the speaking school, the apartment cannot be refunded, and I'm almost certain the flight routes to Mexico are few, expensive and far inbetween. I missed my window of going back, and my parents are both over 60 and my father had a trombosis some years ago; the travel by flights would surely skyrocket my chances of becoming infected and thus infecting them.

I feel like I'm going insane. I'm here until June and I don't know if we will have some breathing air anytime soon. The German government is to get together on the 20th to discuss easings, and I pray so fervently we might get some breathing air.. I miss human contact so much. I miss my school, though I'm quite sure I can kiss that goodbye for sure. 

I'm here until June, that is if my flight doesn't get cancelled and then I'm fucked. But right now my concern is just being able to return to some modicum of normalcy, to be able to see a friend, to be able to drink a coffee or maybe go to a store to buy something.

I miss my school, though I&amp;#39;m quite sure I can kiss that goodbye for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m here until June, that is if my flight doesn&amp;#39;t get cancelled and then I&amp;#39;m fucked. But right now my concern is just being able to return to some modicum of normalcy, to be able to see a friend, to be able to drink a coffee or maybe go to a store to buy something. I&amp;#39;m 100% on board with social distancing, I&amp;#39;ll be the first to download a tracking app and wear facemasks, I just miss life so fucking bad and I feel like I&amp;#39;m going insane.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"I am mentally kicking myself. I quit my job right before this entire pandemic blew up because of the mental toll having a manager of such difficulty took. I've been slowly job hunting since December 2019 and applied to a few jobs, but when the interviews hit I just didn't have the energy to really nail it. I felt that I should take the time to really study for the interviews and give them my best self, something I couldn't do while employed at the current position because of the sheer number of responsibilities I had, from HR to contract-writing to accounting to executive assistant. That job bled so much into my life if I wasn't thinking about it, I was dreaming about it, or complaining about it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyhow, I wanted to go out as professionally as possible before I hit my breaking point, so I put in my notice and left the mess of a company behind. Social distancing started almost right after, and I had one interview before the hiring process to, well, everywhere, stopped completely. Literally right after my interview that day, a bit after I'd left my job, I received an email from the prospective workplace and everyone else that the hiring process has been delayed. Now there are very few job postings in my field, and if there are it's by a recruiter who may just be baiting.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I am unemployed without any job prospects. Had I known this would happen so fast maybe I would've kept my position, but at the same time, even thinking about it now absolutely terrifies me.  

&amp;nbsp;

Almost everyone qualifies for some kind of unemployment under the COVID-19 stimulus package, but nowhere does it mention someone in my position. Sure, I have some savings to get me through, but that was meant to be until my next job (which doesn't take me very long normally), and I was also open to a part-time job if I felt the need to. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now if I were to be a part-timer it'd be at the risk of getting coronavirus, I just don't want to burden the healthcare system any more than it currently is or risk my loved ones. I'm taking this time to try to learn more skills, and be positive, but... I'm really at a loss here. I know it's my fault for lack of foresight, but god knows how long the impact will last will be on the job market. * insert curse word of choice * I know that I'm still very fortunate compared to many, many others out there, but I am nonetheless furious at myself for the poor timing.

,COVID19_support,"I live in the United States, where things are getting pretty bad. But I keep thinking about India.

When I was a college student, I had Indian classmates--international students. They were the ones you could always count on to do their part in a group project; they were the ones setting the curve. Once you got past their accents, they were just as nice and personable as anybody else. And they had a passion for learning. I guess it stands to reason that if you are willing to go to a whole different country to go to college, you would have to be somebody who really cares about learning.

Now I can't stop thinking about them--the laughing fellow who could make magic with circuit diagrams, the tiny short girl who's probably a top-notch medical resident by now judging by how well she could explain anything in anatomy. I graduated years ago, so they must be home now.

About how they're crowded in the cities, and isolated in the countryside, and have so many languages that sometimes it's hard for doctors to even communicate with patients. They love technology, they love science, but they're just getting started putting it in place. There are lots of places where you can't even get Internet.

And here I am, in the United States, looking at New York City on the news and seeing Mumbai or New Delhi, and I just... feel so helpless.

,COVID19_support,"Hey everyone, I posted in a worried frenzy [last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fss8gn/my_uncle_has_it/) about my uncle, who has Covid-19 pretty badly. I'm posting an update on that.

During the week, things were slowly getting better. He started opening his eyes, responding almost on command, his numbers were improving, etc. It was... really nice, and a relief.

However, Tuesdays don't seem to be lucky for us. This morning, around 5AM EST, he had a heart attack and coded. I guess he nearly coded this afternoon too, but they managed to stop it in time. Things aren't looking good again, and the doctor asked my aunt to decide whether or not to revive him if he codes again. She's beside herself, and doesn't know how to make that decision. Again, my family (minus me) is very Catholic so she called a priest, doesn't want to play God, etc. I think she's leaning towards not giving them permission, because she doesn't want to give up on him, but she's not making a decision tonight, anyway.

They were going to try that Ecmo method as a last resort, but apparently that's off the table now, I don't know. The doctor doesn't have high hopes, as he hasn't seen anyone come back from my uncle's ""critically ill"" state.

This whole experience has been horrifying. This is my closest uncle, he's always been there for me and I love him dearly. I can't even imagine a world without him. I know I should start to prepare myself for that, but... I can't stop hoping. My family's praying like crazy. I don't know, he improved before, he might be able to do it again, right? 

I don't want to hope too much, but I don't want to give up on him. I don't know what to do.

**EDIT 4/8/20 1AM EST:** The night nurse taking care of my uncle was more optimistic than the doctor, saying he's back to how he was a few days ago. I hate this back-and-forth, it's going to drive me insane. Will keep posting updates on this post.

**EDIT 4/12/20 5PM EST:** He had been doing better again for a while, even being off the vent, awake, and alert yesterday. He was speaking to the nurse, could answer memory questions, etc. However, this morning, he coded again. My aunt told them to continue reviving him, and they did so. He has a pacemaker in now, and is currently having an abdominal/pelvic scan (he's been having kidney issues too so I think it's for that). Obviously, the doctors wouldn't have put a pacemaker in if they thought he was too far gone, so... while I'm worried, I'm not as wrecked as I was before.

**EDIT 4/14/20 10AM EST:** It's always Tuesday that there's a major problem. He'd been stable again for a few days, and then I guess his oxygen levels dropped last night from 99 to 69 or so, and his organs are failing. I don't understand why we keep getting good news then bad news, over and over again for almost a month now. I don't know what to think, I don't trust anything I hear because he always miraculously seems to bounce back somehow, then get worse.

,COVID19_support,"Hi there!

I'm in a large city that has a significant amount of cases, around 1,300 for a population of 3 million. Not a lot, but also who knows what the real number is. We are on social isolation protocol, only go out if necessary for things like groceries and exercise. My whole family lives here, my parents in a big house with a backyard and my two siblings in condos with their partners.

My parents (63, dad is overweight + has diabetes and mom has asthma) announced last week that they wanted to start having one of us plus our partners over for dinner on the patio once a week once the weather improves. The idea would be that we sit on opposite sides on the table and keep 2 meter distance the whole time. I argued you defeat the whole purpose of ""social distancing"" by introducing shared cutlery and passing food around. While I don't think going over for dinner is considered illegal (our max group size has been set at 5) it definitely walks a fine line. Also why is this even up for debate - both of them are in the ""at-risk"" category?!?

My parents excuse was this is going to go on for awhile and they have to keep living their lives. They called it a ""calculated risk"". (Honestly I think they are just bored out of their minds because they're retired and have nothing to do). Any point I brought up was dismissed.

I am extremely unhappy about the idea (in case you couldn't tell) since my area hasn't even reached our projected peak yet. Why are we even considering risking our health and possibly unnecessarily increasing the burden on the healthcare system? I find it incredibly selfish but no one in my family seems to understand my view and keeps passing it off as me worrying too much. I do have anxiety and I've been trying to keep my anxiety thoughts to myself lately but I can't stay quiet about this.

I tried to compromise with them, saying maybe it's okay if two people come over but only for drinks and you bring whatever cups/drinks you need from home and take them back with you. That's an option up for discussion but I have a feeling it won't stick. I really thought my sisters would understand but even my sister who used to work in a hospital seems to be okay with this idea.

Does anyone have a useful argument that they think might work against my family? Am I overreacting? The cases in my city aren't bad but I just think it's way too early to start loosening restrictions.

TL;DR My parents want us to come over for ""social distancing"" dinners and won't listen to my reasoning. My whole family seems to be on board with the idea except me and my partner. Need help convincing them not to do it.

&lt;p&gt;I tried to compromise with them, saying maybe it&amp;#39;s okay if two people come over but only for drinks and you bring whatever cups/drinks you need from home and take them back with you. That&amp;#39;s an option up for discussion but I have a feeling it won&amp;#39;t stick. I really thought my sisters would understand but even my sister who used to work in a hospital seems to be okay with this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have a useful argument that they think might work against my family? Am I overreacting? The cases in my city aren&amp;#39;t bad but I just think it&amp;#39;s way too early to start loosening restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR My parents want us to come over for &amp;quot;social distancing&amp;quot; dinners and won&amp;#39;t listen to my reasoning. My whole family seems to be on board with the idea except me and my partner. Need help convincing them not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. I&amp;#39;m sorry it&amp;#39;s probably a lot of word vomit.&lt;/p&gt;

\#1: A) Are we trying to cure all infected people of Coronavirus so there is no more ill person or B) we are trying to infect everyone at a slow rate so that no more person is left to infect?

\#2: If the answer to #1 is ""A"", is it even possible, considering it's increasing day by day?

\#3: If the answer to #1 is ""B"", why we introduced lockdown so soon. I think it would have made more sense to introduce lockdown when there were at least 25K patients all over the country. Now we have to wait for more time to reach the peak, which means more days of lockdown.

\#4: If the answer is not either ""A"" or ""B"",  then C) what is our current strategy? D) How it will end the Coronavirus? E) Does it require full lockdown throughout the country?

,COVID19_support,"His ICU doctor has changed about 4 times now. This current doctor I've met before on a pharmacy rotation at one of the network hospitals almost 3  years ago. He's a hard military man who got out of active duty and now works in critical care. He was cold and unforgiving when I was a student, and when I talked to him today, he's about the same.

My older brother (I'm 26) went to the hospital March 25th with COVID like symptoms and then intubated the day after he was admitted with a fever of 102F. Everyday I asked the hospital staff information about his labs, his breathing progression, his kidneys, organs, medications, any information that would help me understand how he was progressing.

I could tell by the labs and his breathing that he really didn't improve much. It's been about 10 days and he's still on a ventilator. They now found blood in his endotracheal tube. The doctor told me that bleeding in patients is easy to treat if it's caused by cancer/tumors, or other external factors, but the fact that he's bleeding means he is bleeding in his lungs. The infection is getting more severe even with antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia.

So today he asked me...  to try and decide. I asked him how much time does my brother have left? He said give or take one or two days. I can't even leave my military base (in Oklahoma) right now to go back to my family (in Pennsylvania) because I still need permission from the General Commander.. My mom tested positive for COVID March 19th and she's technically still on quarantine with my dad who was negative.  My mom has been begging me not to come because she doesn't want to see me get sick and end up like my brother. But I told her that I need to come home, I don't think the hospital staff will let me see him but if he... passes... I want to see his body at least.

The doctor said we can either

1. continue to let him stay sedated... see if he can try to continue to fight his infections. He would need to significantly improve in a matter of a day or two, if he doesn't then he's probably going to... pass away... sedated, while trying to fight.
2. wake him up. say our last good byes.

I'm scared to have to make a decision. I talked to his boyfriend and he told me that my brother would want to keep fighting. I want him to fight too  but I know my mom wants to say bye, but we can't go into the hospital to say goodbye. It would have to be over video call... He would die alone in the hospital without anyone. he would be woken up after 10-14 days of being asleep and being suddenly told ""we can't save you. Say good bye forever."" I can't bear it. I'm falling apart at the seems. For anyone who's reading this thank you for reading it all. I would like for anyone to tell me if they had to make a hard decision like this before or if they lost anyone and what it was like. I've never lost a family member before... I am just totally lost. Thank you.

tldr; older brother,31 relatively healthy ended up on a ventilator for 10-12 days. doctor told my family either we let him keep fighting for 1-2 more days to see if he gets better, if not he will die regardless or we wake him up and say good bye remotely from phone call.

Her name was Amanda. She was 64. Ultimately after hearing all the options I decided it was enough. She never wanted to live long enough to where she couldn’t feed or bathe herself. She used to say she never wanted to prolong death, she wanted it to come quick. The doctor said the week in the coma destroyed her organs and damaged her brain, so she even if by some miracle she survives, which was almost impossible, she would never come close to living a normal life again.

Her life was just suffering and being in and out of hospitals. She was born with kidney disease and for me, from growing up until now it was always just seeing her on dialysis and in and out of hospitals. Over the last 10 years she probably had over a dozen serious hospitalizations. I’ve got too many memories of her being hooked up to machines. I will always be so full of anger that she could never experience a healthy life.

I will never forgive myself for several things. She knew I cared but I’m just a cold person by nature. I never sat and had a meal with her. No real conversations. Never went for a walk with her. The last time I fucking even hugged her was 2 years ago when I went to visit her in the hospital every day when she had pneumonia. Almost every day for the past few years I knew this was going to happen. She was going to die I was going to let regret eat me alive. I should have been better. 

But I did love her. I tried my best to make sure her doctors appointments and medications were set and always tried to get an idea on how she was feeling. Even if she was feeling bad she never wanted to show it. My half assed attempt to make up for lost time was taking her and her sister to Cirque Du Solei over the past two years. Just so she could experience something different in life, since she never went anywhere. April fucking 5th I had front row tickets for her and her sister. 2 months ago when I bought them I just hoped and hoped she would stay healthy enough to go, and then all this happened.

Probably the biggest thing that I will never forgive myself for is her last request. She knew I was a fuck up, but was always too nice to say it. Her sister told me a year ago that all she wanted to see before she died was me happy with a decent job, I couldn’t give her that. Nobody to blame but myself though. Almost 35 and nothing to fucking show for it. I’ll never forgive myself for that. I’m just worried about my brother who can’t look after himself. She was everything to him.

Meanwhile, I tested positive for covid, brother and dad negative and my aunt’s test hasn’t come back yet. I’m getting retested on Tuesday. I can’t fucking stay locked in this small room anymore.

I’m hesitant to post this, but unbeknownst to me, my girlfriend set up a GoFundMe to help with burial costs over the weekend

&lt;p&gt;Her name was Amanda. She was 64. Ultimately after hearing all the options I decided it was enough. She never wanted to live long enough to where she couldn’t feed or bathe herself. She used to say she never wanted to prolong death, she wanted it to come quick. The doctor said the week in the coma destroyed her organs and damaged her brain, so she even if by some miracle she survives, which was almost impossible, she would never come close to living a normal life again.&lt;/p&gt;

At the end of February, she had her first treatment of radiation since she can’t have chemo, it’s a type of radio-embolism and she’s been shushing me in regards to wanting to ask her doctors about if she’s at risk, so I haven’t, even though everything online from government type websites (state, federal, WHO) says otherwise. I have been seriously shushed by my psychiatrist because, as she’s read in her medical journals, everything points to COVID being like the flu and she sees that my mom isn’t at risk because she isn’t going thru chemo specifically. I lost my shit in our last in person session because our communication isn’t working in regards to this, where it’s otherwise superb and I owe her a lot which promoted her to having me take a break from social media &amp; any information about COVID. **I’m not getting a different psychiatrist.**


Then today, I was in a telemed appointment with my primary physician and I asked her if my mom was at risk, she said absolutely and pointed out that radiation therapies wreak havoc on the person’s immune system. We touched on what my mom was doing to keep herself safe, and we both shared eye rolls. 


My mom was a career RN who just retired in March. She worked in a trauma 1 hospital which has an infectious disease protocol that she has plenty of experience in as she’s so helpfully pointed out in detail to me repeatedly. Thankfully she started following our governor’s executive orders, but not to a T. She’s staying home more, but not keeping distance from people when she goes out. She begrudgingly made a mask, but today her eye roll when prompted to put it on before getting out of her car at the grocery store probably shook the trees. I know she doesn’t wear it when I’m not there to tell her to. She doesn’t distance herself from anyone who comes over to her house. She’s of the mindset that it’s another flu and everyone is flipping out for no reason. That the death rate is nothing compared to the flu. She thinks the sneeze shields at stores, the postponement or cancelation of all sports, the shutting down of the economy, all of it is blowing it way out of proportion and unnecessary. My psychiatrist agrees.

He works for the NHS and his job is transferring patients to and from the hospital (non-emergency) On the 1st he self isolated due to a cough. On the 3rd he had aches and pains and on the 4th I heard him trying to throw up in the bathroom but he said nothing would come up.

On the 4th he also got tested. He still has aches and pains and a cough today, his temperature is normal as of last check. I'm certain he has it because of apparent symptoms. 

My anxiety is overwhelming due to two reasons one being he is not a spring chicken and overweight. I know from combing over covid news that a majority percentage of people in ICU are the overweight. Second reason his disregard for the severity of the situation. I was taking a nap today and woke up to find him burning rubbish in the garden. I told him to at least move away from the smoke owing to what type of virus this is. But all he said was he had to keep the fire going.

,COVID19_support,"Located in NY.  I've been staying home the past 3 weeks - not even visits to the grocery store, etc - with the exception of very limited walks around my neighborhood and avoiding other people while doing so.  I do get food and packages delivered, but always wash my hands immediately after opening them, and treat the boxes or bags as radioactive.

One thing I've been struggling with is breaking the habit of touching my face - rubbing my eyes, scratching my nose, picking food out of my teeth - before realizing ""oh shit"" and catching myself.  I'm working on it!

&gt; **Virus Toll in N.Y. Region Shows Signs of Leveling Off: Live Updates**
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; Data from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut suggested that steps  to control the coronavirus’s spread might be working.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; New York officials said the Regents exams scheduled for June, which help determine graduation eligibility for many high school students, would be canceled.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Deaths were relatively flat across the region.**
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; For days, officials in and around New York sought indications that the coronavirus was nearing a peak in the region — the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic — and might start leveling off.
&gt; 
&gt; And for days, the death toll climbed faster and faster.  In New York State, for instance, it rose by more than 200, then more than 400, then 630 people in a single day.
&gt; 
&gt; But on Monday, for the second day in a row, officials found reasons for hope even as hundreds of people continued to die and thousands clung to life on ventilators.
&gt; 
&gt; On both Sunday and Monday, fewer than 600 deaths from the virus were reported in New York: 594 on Sunday, 599 on Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said.
&gt; 
&gt; In New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy reported a similar trend: 71 reported deaths on Monday, and 86 on Sunday, after a three-day streak when deaths had broken triple digits.
&gt; 
&gt; And in Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont on Monday reported a one-day death toll of 17, the smallest number since last Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Cuomo said the data suggested that the spread of the virus in New York was nearing its apex, but he emphasized that the state remained in a dire, unsustainable state of emergency.
&gt; 
&gt; “If we are plateauing, we are plateauing at a very high level and there is tremendous stress on the health care system,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Here were the latest numbers from the day:
&gt; 
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Deaths in New York State:** 4,758, up 599 from 4,159 on Sunday morning.
&gt; 
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; **Confirmed cases:** 130,689, up from 122,031 in New York. In New York City, 72,181, up from 67,551.
&gt; 
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; **Hospitalized in New York State:** 16,837, up 2 percent from 16,479 on Sunday. It was the third straight day of single-digit percentage growth, after a long period when hospitalizations were growing 20 to 30 percent a day.
&gt; 
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; **In intensive care:** 4,504, up 2 percent from 4,376 on Sunday. The day-over-day increase, 128, was the smallest in at least two weeks. Last week, the number of people in intensive care beds, which have ventilators, was growing by more than 300 people a day.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Even if the  infection curve is flattening, the virus’s daily toll remains horrific.
&gt; 
&gt; New York City reported a one-day total of 219 deaths on Monday morning, bringing the city’s death toll to 2,475. Before the virus outbreak, the average death rate in New York City was 158 people a day, meaning the virus is now killing considerably more people in the city than  all other causes combined.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Cuomo asserted that New York had done all it could to prevent the loss of lives that could have been saved.
&gt; 
&gt; “Have we saved everyone?” he said. “No. But have we lost anyone because we didn’t have a bed or we didn’t have a ventilator, or we didn’t have health care staff? No.”
&gt; 
&gt; In a notable shift from previous weeks, when he pleaded for more ventilators from the federal government and other states, he said New York was now adequately stocked.
&gt; 
&gt; “We don’t need any additional ventilators right now,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **No Regents tests, or spring break, for N.Y.C. public school students.**
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; State officials said on Monday that its June Regents examinations for high school students would be canceled. Many high school students in New York State take the exams, which  help determine graduation eligibility, in June.
&gt; 
&gt; It was not clear whether the August Regents, which give students a second chance to qualify for a state diploma, would also be canceled. The Board of Regents, led by chancellor Betty Rosa, is expected to announce more details about the August exams and how the changes will affect graduation requirements on Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; The state had already canceled standardized exams planned for the spring for students in grades three through eight.
&gt; 
&gt; New York City schools had been scheduled to closed starting Thursday through the end of next week for Passover, Good Friday, and spring break. Students are now expected to continue their remote learning during that time.
&gt; 
&gt; The state has said that remote instruction must continue, regardless of whether districts like New York City had spring break scheduled.
&gt; 
&gt; The teachers union sent out an email on Friday berating the city for making teachers work on major religious holidays. The city’s education department and the union subsequently struck a deal that gives teachers four extra days off that can be used for religious holidays.
&gt; 
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; **There is a contingency plan for mass graves in a park.**
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; With the number of city residents dying of the virus outpacing the system’s capacity to handle them, officials are considering temporarily burying people in mass graves in a park, the chairman of the City Council’s health committee, said on Monday.
&gt; 
&gt; “It will be done in a dignified, orderly — and temporary — manner,” the chairman, City Councilman Mark Levine, wrote on Twitter. “But it will be tough for NYers to take.”
&gt; 
&gt; https://twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1247156026333413376
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Levine said “temporary interment” could “avoid scenes like those in Italy, where the military was forced to collect bodies from churches and even off the streets.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mayor Bill de Blasio said no such plan had been put in place.
&gt; 
&gt; “If we need to do temporary burials to be able to tide us over to pass the crisis and then work with each family on their appropriate arrangements, we have the ability to do that,” he said when asked about Mr. Levine’s comment later on Monday.
&gt; 
&gt; But he said the city was “not at the point that we’re going to go into that.”
&gt; 
&gt; Governor Cuomo said at his noon briefing that he had heard nothing about such a possibility.
&gt; 
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; “I have heard a lot of wild rumors but I have not heard anything about the city burying people in parks,” Mr. Cuomo said.
&gt; 
&gt; After the mayor and governor weighed in — and after Mr. Levine’s comments caused a panic among some New Yorkers — the councilman wrote on Twitter that what he was describing was a contingency plan and that “if the death rate drops enough it will not be necessary.”
&gt; 
&gt; In an interview, Mr. Levine, who represents Upper Manhattan, declined to identify which  park or parks might be used, but he said, “I presume it would have to be a large park with some inaccessible areas that are out of the way of the public.”
&gt; 
&gt; Temporary burials are part of a 2008 plan prepared by the city medical examiner’s office to deal with a pandemic. “Tier One” of the plan involves storing bodies in freezer trucks and easing restrictions on crematories. The cityhas already taken those steps.
&gt; 
&gt; **Deaths in New Jersey pass 1,000.**
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Murphy said on Monday that there had been 3,663 new confirmed virus cases in New Jersey since the day before, bringing the state’s total to 41,090. He also noted the 86 new deaths, which brought New Jersey’s total to 1,003.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Murphy arrived at the news conference where he delivered the numbers wearing a face mask, which he removed before speaking.
&gt; 
&gt; “Our protocol has been that when we’re in any setting with more than a modest amount of folks, we’re going to wear our masks, including for press conferences, both coming in and leaving,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The governor shared data showing that while the number of positive case results continued to rise, there had been a decline in the growth rate over the past week, from 24 percent day-over-day on March 30 to about 12 percent as of Monday.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nurses at Harlem Hospital protested for better gear.**
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; “P-P-E.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Every day.”
&gt; 
&gt; “And every day.”
&gt; 
&gt; “P-P-E.”
&gt; 
&gt; That was the call-and-response outside Harlem Hospital Center on Monday, as dozens of nurses protested for more personal protective equipment.
&gt; 
&gt; On the sidewalk out the hospital, the names of health care workers who died after treating coronavirus patients were written in brightly colored chalk.
&gt; 
&gt; The Manhattan hospital has been inundated with virus patients, including some who were transferred from hospitals in Queens and the Bronx.
&gt; 
&gt; But the hospital staff has been stretched thin and critical workers have been provided with little protective equipment, nurses said. The hospital has only a small number of respiratory therapists, and staff members get one N95 mask to wear for five 12-hours shifts, said Sarah Dowd, a staff nurse who helped organize the protest.
&gt; 
&gt; “We deserve better,” she said, reciting a list of demands that includes at least one mask a day for hospital workers, and more nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists.
&gt; 
&gt; The Harlem nurses were joined by counterparts from other public and private hospitals in the city. The protesters held signs that read, “Patients before Profits” and “Who Will Care for You When We Are Dead?”
&gt; 
&gt; Foluke Fashakin, a nurse who was at Harlem Hospital, said that nurses were wearing the same equipment to treat those who were infected and those who were not.
&gt; 
&gt; “We are not comfortable with this kind of system,” she said.
&gt; 
&gt; **New York is ending a program to close some streets.**
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; New York City will end a pilot program that had closed some streets in each borough to vehicles, officials said on Monday.
&gt; 
&gt; A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio said that the initiative, which was started to create more space for pedestrians, required 80 city police officers to shut each six- to seven-block stretch.
&gt; 
&gt; Officials decided after a two-week trial that not enough people were taking advantage of the program to justify it, according to the spokeswoman, Jane Meyer.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. de Blasio had said on Sunday that he wanted to continue testing the program because bad weather might have discouraged people from going outside during the two weeks it was in effect.
&gt; 
&gt; **Stringer says Trump has “my mom’s blood on his hands.**
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; Scott Stringer, New York City’s comptroller, lashed out at President Trump on Monday over his response to the coronavirus outbreak, blaming the president for the death of his mother, Arlene Stringer-Cuevas.
&gt; 
&gt; “Donald Trump has blood on his hands, and he has my mom’s blood on his hands” he wrote on Twitter.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Stringer faulted Mr. Trump for the fact that the 1,000 beds on a Navy hospital ship sent to New York amid the crisis were reserved for patients were not infected with the virus.
&gt; 
&gt; Ms. Stringer-Cuevas, 86, died on Friday. She was the first woman to represent Manhattan’s Washington Heights neighborhood on the City Council.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Stringer, who called his mother a “a genuine trailblazer” in announcing her death, described the difficulty of mourning with restrictions in place.
&gt; 
&gt; “Perhaps the thing I struggle with the most is, how do you mourn at a time where you can’t connect with people?” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; **As virus spreads, crime plunges across New York.**
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; Crime has plummeted in New York City and across the state since the governor announced a stay-at-home order more than three weeks ago, data released on Monday shows.
&gt; 
&gt; In New York City, the number of felony and misdemeanor cases dropped a collective 43.3 percent from March 18 to March 24, compared with the same period in 2019, according to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services.
&gt; 
&gt; All other regions in the state experienced an even greater decline over the same period: a drop of nearly 69 percent in misdemeanors and felonies.
&gt; 
&gt; The number of felonies specifically dipped 33 percent in New York City and 60 percent in the rest of the state.

&lt;p&gt;“We are not comfortable with this kind of system,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York is ending a program to close some streets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City will end a pilot program that had closed some streets in each borough to vehicles, officials said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio said that the initiative, which was started to create more space for pedestrians, required 80 city police officers to shut each six- to seven-block stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials decided after a two-week trial that not enough people were taking advantage of the program to justify it, according to the spokeswoman, Jane Meyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. de Blasio had said on Sunday that he wanted to continue testing the program because bad weather might have discouraged people from going outside during the two weeks it was in effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stringer says Trump has “my mom’s blood on his hands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Stringer, New York City’s comptroller, lashed out at President Trump on Monday over his response to the coronavirus outbreak, blaming the president for the death of his mother, Arlene Stringer-Cuevas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Donald Trump has blood on his hands, and he has my mom’s blood on his hands” he wrote on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stringer faulted Mr. Trump for the fact that the 1,000 beds on a Navy hospital ship sent to New York amid the crisis were reserved for patients were not infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Stringer-Cuevas, 86, died on Friday. She was the first woman to represent Manhattan’s Washington Heights neighborhood on the City Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stringer, who called his mother a “a genuine trailblazer” in announcing her death, described the difficulty of mourning with restrictions in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps the thing I struggle with the most is, how do you mourn at a time where you can’t connect with people?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As virus spreads, crime plunges across New York.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crime has plummeted in New York City and across the state since the governor announced a stay-at-home order more than three weeks ago, data released on Monday shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New York City, the number of felony and misdemeanor cases dropped a collective 43.3 percent from March 18 to March 24, compared with the same period in 2019, according to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All other regions in the state experienced an even greater decline over the same period: a drop of nearly 69 percent in misdemeanors and felonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of felonies specifically dipped 33 percent in New York City and 60 percent in the rest of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

Longer version...

We live in a small city in New England in an apartment building. I am immunocompromised and have been sick for almost 8 weeks (~~don't know with what, but it is respiratory- was starting to get better but in the last few days getting sicker- don't know if it is the same illness or a new one~~ - switched to a different doctor who says she thinks it is C19 - my last doctor kept ignoring me &amp; minimizing my symptoms to the point of incompetence [she told me I couldn't breathe because I had ""grief in my lungs"" because my sister died] - new doctor was alarmed the other one was not better educated about C19).

I have basically been home for 2 months, except for a few trips for food/medicine and three trips to the doctor. I do take brief walks occasionally (doctor said I had to as I was developing a blood clot in my leg) but I wear a scarf or mask over my face &amp; don't walk near people. Other than that, I stay in the apartment. 

My partner works three days a week as a cashier/stocker at a Walgreens. He also goes out to the convenience store or small local grocery store pretty often. I've asked him to wear a mask at work &amp; he finally agreed to it yesterday but took it off because it was uncomfortable. His store does not have plexiglass up for the checkout counter (they may be doing it at some point).

He has been very good about washing his hands when he comes in from outside &amp; sanitizing his hands at work. Other than that, he tends to think I am overreacting when I ask for other measures (like taking his shoes off when he comes in or me wanting to clean packages from the store) though he did take a shower after work last night when I asked.

He goes out back of our building to smoke frequently &amp; last night he was gone so long, I went to see if he was locked out and found him standing 2-3 feet away from a neighbor smoking &amp; chatting. I reminded him people are supposed to stay a minimum of 6 feet away from each other &amp; they both thought I was joking &amp; he told me that he didn't have to because this was our neighbor (this is a man neither of us have ever spoken to or hung out with, he just lives on our floor). I got really upset because that made me feel like he has a basic lack of understanding about what people are supposed to be doing to slow down the spread (and for him to help keep me safe).

He argued that I have been overreacting, being paranoid, taking things too far, that he spends all day at work in close contact with people so it doesn't matter if he hangs out next to a neighbor, that the 6 foot distance is just to avoid coughs (""and that guy wasn't sick"") and that if he is out &amp; sees someone he knows, he's ""going to stop and talk to them &amp; not worry about being 6 feet away from them"". He also keeps insisting that he has probably already had it or has it now because of his job, but has also said there aren't many cases in our state so we don't need to worry that much. He is also pretty convinced that I've been sick with C-19 so I don't need to worry about getting it (I had a negative test- it was after being sick for 5 weeks so who knows how accurate it was).

I don't know how to get through to him how important it is to keep isolated as much as possible and how much more dangerous it is for me to get sick. Even if I had C-19, my immune system doesn't work properly so I may never make enough antibodies to protect me (from any virus).

Im 32, 490 lbs, and living with an essential roommate. Last Saturday he went to the house of his fave barber to get a line up and a 360 wave improvement. there was about 7 other people in the house with him... Then he went with a co-worker to tag along as the co-worker did some business.

My roommate is a fabricator for a commercial plumbing and drainage firm. He can get a mask if he wants to, but is reluctant to do so - he's a bit of an oddball. So I was giving him a massage on the living room couch. As I was finished with his feet, he took a deep exhale - this from a man who in his late 50s, overweight, and with apnea. He sneezed once today, and that was before he ate his food (he washed his hands) After the message I went to check up on the news. While I was being informed I suddenly remembered the talk about asymptomatic, respiratory droplets and aerosols and my anxiety meter went through the roof. 

Now I have just broke my isolation to get some flip-flops on the behest of my roommate, who called me a coward. I can see where he's coming from, but no one calls me a coward. So I grabbed the mask he got from work, the vial of rubbing alcohol i use daily and took off. I was in and out of the local Walmart in an hour (looking for cleaning products, alcohol and peroxide - none to be found btw.) I got my shoes and drink mix (as if often calms me down.)

My MIL is a classic anti-vaxxer, thinks this is a 5G conspiracy, being blown out of proportion, attempt to attack Trump, etc, etc. Her already unbalanced beliefs and actions have lead to a generally toxic relationship between her, my husband and me and our two toddlers. We have established strong boundaries and know how to stand up to her but she loves to lay on the guilt trip, set herself up as a victim, and pits my husband’s brother against him as her defender and peacekeeper, which generally sucks. 

today she has texted the group chat we are all in stating that Easter dinner will be at the usual time next Sunday. Like what?? We said we will be happy to FaceTime in and waited for her response. She immediately shot back- “if we are all healthy why is Easter on FaceTime?” We didn’t respond, though I think we probably need to write one calm one-liner about how we aren’t attending any gatherings. 

The most frustrating part is that my husband’s brother has been allowing her to pick up his 6 month old and babysit him at her house. I’m not sure if they are planning to go to her house for Easter or not but if they’re letting her babysit I think they might. There is no legitimate childcare related need to do this as he is not working right now and his wife is working from home so they’re just increasing their risk of infection. My MIL is a cancer survivor so she should not be taking any risks as is. I can’t imagine what is possessing them to do this other than she doesn’t take the virus seriously and he can’t help but try to keep her happy.

We are need to make sacrifices for the common good. This situation really has the potential to bring out the best and worst in people. I wish I could go off on her but she knows the guidelines and statistics and either thinks they are lies or don’t apply to her. Also, her birthday is in two days so she’s going to guilt us about this too. I’m so grateful my husband and I are on the same team and support each other in dealing with her and keeping her at a distance because this type of toxic relationship is so stressful and can be damaging.

Why is it taking her 2 weeks to get her results? The funny thing is is that 2 weeks before she was sick, I had an upper respiratory infection and I just thought she caught what I had. I never developed a fever or anything, but she did.

I keep thinking that by July 4th, everything will go back to normal. I’ll be able to go on a plane and visit my family back in PA and go to restaurants and be happy. But this just seems way too optimistic now. Oh yeah, and I’m supposed to get married in November, LMAO.

Why is it taking her 2 weeks to get her results? The funny thing is is that 2 weeks before she was sick, I had an upper respiratory infection and I just thought she caught what I had. I never developed a fever or anything, but she did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking that by July 4th, everything will go back to normal. I’ll be able to go on a plane and visit my family back in PA and go to restaurants and be happy. But this just seems way too optimistic now. Oh yeah, and I’m supposed to get married in November, LMAO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know no one can give me an answer as to when things will alleviate, but this week has been hard. I’m tired of having to take a shower everyday I step outside of the house. I miss all of our old lives. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

My stomach feels sort of upset (though not enough for me to say I'm exactly sick to my stomach) and what I rationally think are my allergies are bothering me (nasal congestion causing some issues on and off with breathing, runny nose, irritated eyes.) But I wouldn't be posting here if I was feeling totally rational.

I recently made the mistake of visiting the subreddit where people are chronicling their firsthand experiences the virus, be it because they or a loved one they're close to has it. One thing I read from a few different accounts is that it gets worse for them at night.

So here I am. I didn't feel well last night either, same problems. Dismissed it as my dinner not agreeing with me, or something like that. I didn't eat the same thing today.

I know it's probably stress, allergies, and bad luck all ganging up on me, and probably not COVID. I haven't left the house in two weeks to the day.

But I live with an essential worker. We try to stay diligent about keeping hands clean, wiping down anything that comes into the house from outside, limited trips to the store... but I know the chances of it being in the house are not zero.

I can't help but wonder if I'd be worried about this being the virus if I didn't know about the mild cases, obscure symptoms, or the fact that it apparently gets worse for some people at night. I mentioned in my last post that my OCD manifests as a compulsive need to be informed about my obsessions and I'm afraid it's coming back to haunt me.

I don't feel entirely calm... but I'm not panicking either. I'm just... upset, worried, on top of just not feeling very well. It's not that I'm scared of catching it all together. It's that I'm scared of dying from it. Or spreading it to someone and making them sick. Even if I knew it'd be shitty, if I could guarantee it wouldn't put me in the hospital or hurt anyone else, I think I'd rather just catch it and get it over with. But those aren't guarantees I can make, so here I am scared out of my mind.

The person I live with has had zero symptoms and practices the best hygiene they can at work. There's no reason to think they have it other than the fact that they're still working. I know whatever's wrong with me now is likely unrelated to the virus. I know that just because there's a pandemic doesn't mean I can't feel shitty for other reasons. I can't say I've been taking the best care of myself throughout this whole ordeal. Sleeping is hard, eating well is harder, doing anything but sitting around and absorbing all the awful information I can find and dissolving into a subsequent panic is *even harder.* I try to work. I try to get exercise (pacing around the house for an hour or more at a time.) My hands burn from all the washing. The whole house smells of disinfectant. I have a newfound, albeit probably minimal, understanding of what it must be like for people with contamination OCD to never feel safe because of a potential virus/bacteria/etc lurking around, waiting to make you sick.

,COVID19_support,"Hi all,

My dad (60 years old- no underlying health conditions- never chain smoked only casual cigars for special occasions) got admitted to the hospital last Thursday. We thought he was doing okay with the noninvasive nostril oxygen but he needed more. The doctor and their team decided to intubate my dad. 

It was very surreal to talk to my dad on the phone and not knowing if it would be the last time that I would ever speak to him. I told him to be strong and we are rooting for him. My dad is now on day 5 and his doctors and nurses have been wonderful. They call me twice in a day to give me updates. The day after he got intubated they called and said his eyes are open and he is writing things down. 

I asked what he was saying and it was things like “how much longer of this? And how is my wife?”... 
:( they said he became super anxious so they needed to sedate him. That was on Tuesday. So every day after they have called saying he is the same... his vitals are stable and he is one of the more stable patients. 

He has been sedated since and isn’t awake... same thing though chest x rays are the same... nothing worsened over night but his lungs still aren’t strong enough to be weened off. I asked the doctor how long they have been having COVID19 patients on these vents for...

She said since it’s so new they aren’t really sure but other hospitals are saying two weeks. I see all the bad news articles and it’s been breaking me down. So I said fuck this I am going to dig for good news and anything I can hang on to for hope...

I found a twitter thread of a nurse asking if anyone had good outcomes of patients coming off the vents and surviving. They said yes actually. They have had patients coming off and recovering! Which made me have more hope. 

I know we can only take this day by day but I was wondering if anyone else is going through something similar like my dads situation? I have found some threads on Reddit and spoke with people whose parents or spouses are going through it as well. I just like to connect and compare notes even though I know every single case is different. 

Stay well to everyone and make sure your mentally okay. I’m here to talk if anyone needs to vent. 🙏🏻♥️

Edit/addition to: My mom got the virus as well not nearly as bad as my dad.. she tried to handle it herself in their house (she’s a nurse) it finally got too bad that we got her an ambulance and rushed her to the hospital. On top of having COVID19 she was experiencing an Afib. They got that sorted out and she stayed in the hospital for 5 days. She got discharged today with an oxygen tank and we don’t know how long she will need oxygen for... I’m happy she is recovering though but I just want my dad to be okay as well

**Update- Day 6 4/5/20** my mom spoke with one of his doctors that she personally knows (so far my mom hasn’t known any of the docs and she is a retired nurse that worked in that hospital for 30 plus years) she said he currently is still stable, doesn’t need that much oxygen help from the machine, he is almost finishing up with his antibiotics so now it’s a wait and see like it has been... but I will take any good news as a step forward. Thank you again everyone for the love and support. I will keep you all updated!

**updated: check out my post on The subreddit CoronavirusUS- i found a picture on Facebook of a New Jersey (not my dads hospital- even though we are in New Jersey) how many people who got off of ventilators and have been discharged in general from the virus... it’s giving me more hope! **

Update 4/7/2020 My mom Just spoke with another anesthesia friend doctor.  She is taking care of My dad today.  Doing the same, very stable.  They are talking about lightening his sedation but not enough that he would be aware.  Too soon to wean off vent but hopefully soon they will start weaning to see how he can breath on his own. 🙏🏻♥️


**Update 4/8/2020** My dad is day 8 being on the vent. He continues to be stable.  Still about the same.  Resting quietly still pretty sedated.  No plans to take him off anytime soon.  His lab work is starting to return slowly towards normal...which is good.  He is the “best” pt and closest to getting off the vent!  His bowels are not moving well, so they are trying something new today. I just wanted to keep you guys updated since I hate reading stories on here where there is no update our outcome! I care about you random strangers and enjoy reading your stories but come on with not updating? Lol stay well fellow redditors! Thank you for the continuous support and prayers!

**update 4/10/20** GREAT NEWS!! They extubated him today after being on the vent for 11 days (lucky number 11 I guess!)  and he is drowsy obviously and still confused but they are moving him out of the ICU to another floor to recover more. His throat is sore (from the tube obviously) and my mom talked to him on the phone and he was just making noises probably because he's still sedated and out of it but he is extubated and recovering. Thank god! We Continue to pray though because he needs the strength to get himself to recover from this!  🙏🏻♥️ thank you to everyone who has been by my side during this horrific time.

,COVID19_support,"So me and my gf haven't seen each other for 3 weeks now, maybe more. She lives 3 miles away from me and we used to see each other every day. Since the outbreak and the shut down in my country begun, we stopped visiting each other. She lives with her parents and I live with my grandma.

She and I work at stores (different ones).

Here's the thing. Even tho we had plans to see each other, we decided that maybe we shouldn't, so that her parents and my granda wouldn't get sick.

,COVID19_support,"So my dad died when I was 18. He had been in a nursing home for 7 years before that. He had MS really bad. He had married a bad woman who would change the locks of the house when she got mad so nobody could come visit my dad or feed him while she was working. Locked me and my sister out completely. The police ended up breaking in and finding my dad emaciated. He went into a nursing home where he got put on a feeding tube, and spent the last 7 years of his life unable to move, eat, scratch an itch, TALK, anything. 
My bad ptsd comes from knowing how much he suffered. Worrying I didn’t see him enough. My mom has mental and health issues and doesn’t drive. Was an alcoholic during this time. I could only visit my dad on the weekends when I had a ride. Sometimes I wonder what he was saying those times I kept asking him to repeat himself and I couldn’t understand him. How frustrating that was for him. 
So since then and still now, I can’t process the pain. I constantly think if my dad would be proud of me. I’m a waitress, how could he be THAT proud? Everytime I mess up at work or get into an argument with someone I always think my dad is watching and is disappointed in me. Can’t even really have sex because I worry I’m embarrassing or disappointing my dad in some way. 
I’m really afraid of getting close to people in my family because I’m afraid when they die I will be like this even more. 
My mom doesn’t drink anymore but she developed COPD from chain smoking dollar store cigarettes while we were growing up (and still). I’m so afraid I’m going to give her the virus while trying to help her stay safe. She can hardly talk without becoming out of breath. 
The reason my step mom locked everyone out the last time, the worst time - was because me and her got into an argument. So I feel sort of responsible. Nobody understands how I cannot afford to feel like another parents death is my fault. Everyone will be sad if their parent dies but I cannot rationalize or work through my pain and that is evident that I am still paralyzed with sadness and secretly cry every day about my dad - but I don’t think it’s a normal amount. 
Fast forward to if I die. Of carona or something else down the road — I feel so guilty that I am going to die before my daughter unless something awful happens to her. And this carona virus is making it seem even closer. I thought about writing her a letter to explain how much I want her to enjoy and love her life and herself no matter what happens to me. That if it’s possible to look over her, that I will, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to see every mistake she makes or judge every bad decision. 
Idk, I’m kind of just venting and I’m not sure what to do. I hope this is allowed. I’m just balling, in secret. My boyfriend is asleep but when he wakes up I have to pretend I’ve been happy all morning. It’s weird to be balling about your dad who died so long ago, so often.

,COVID19_support,"So, like most of you, I'm sure, I keep flipping out about potential symptoms. I have bad allergies and acid reflux (which had pretty much gone away previously, but stressing about this outbreak has brought it back). Both of which cause a lot of the symptoms of Covid19 (sore throat, chest pressure, a dry cough, etc.).

And then, of course, there's the panic disorder and OCD, which will let my body mimic basically all the symptoms.

But I read something recently that tends to calm me down, once I start fixating on potential symptoms. The minute i start getting a dry throat, or I cough a few times, or my face feels flushed, I worry that it's a medical emergency and I have to get help NOW. But the advice I found said to only go to a doctor if you would have gone to a doctor for the symptoms if there was no pandemic.  


So, a minor sore throat? Don't go. A cough a few times? Don't go. A super low-grade fever? Don't go. Trouble breathing, or an extremely high fever, or something like that? Call you doctor.  


Obviously, this advice doesn't mean ""go out and spread your germs"" or ""disregard something severe happening"". But in general, this has really helped soothe me. I'll gauge my symptoms by how I would have reacted to them prior to Covid19. Yes, all symptoms have ALWAYS stressed me out, but I never would have actually made an appointment for a dry throat before (especially if I have other tell-tale signs of an allergy attack, etc.).   


I hope this helps someone else too!

,COVID19_support,"It's been almost a week, (Sunday the 5th is day 7) since I was in the ER. I'm now in that ""sweet spot"" for symptoms to start showing if I contracted it. 

I've been trying to distract myself all week. I feel like I'm in hell. Every ache, pain, funny smell or lack or smell, every sniffle, dry or wet cough, seems to set me on edge. 

I wish I could take it back. I wish I never went to the ER. If I didn't have anxiety, I wouldn't be in this mess to begin with. 

I can't get Covid-19. I have an autoimmune disease. I don't want to suffer. I don't want to suffocate. I don't want to die. 

My daughter and husband are worried. I had a single cough in the night and my husband woke up, put his hand on me and told me he loved me. As sweet as it is, I at times feel like he's preparing for me to die. 

I talk to my therapist. I have anxiety medication now (pharmacy is dropping it off on Monday).

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to distract myself all week. I feel like I&amp;#39;m in hell. Every ache, pain, funny smell or lack or smell, every sniffle, dry or wet cough, seems to set me on edge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could take it back. I wish I never went to the ER. If I didn&amp;#39;t have anxiety, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be in this mess to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t get Covid-19. I have an autoimmune disease. I don&amp;#39;t want to suffer. I don&amp;#39;t want to suffocate. I don&amp;#39;t want to die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter and husband are worried. I had a single cough in the night and my husband woke up, put his hand on me and told me he loved me. As sweet as it is, I at times feel like he&amp;#39;s preparing for me to die. &lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"Hi guys, I'm an italian guy and I'm living the worst nightmare of my life. Unfortunately I suffer from OCD, and so it's a terrible period for me. It's a month that my psyche is kind of agonizing. Whenever I hear someone coughing I start to panic. I'm always tortured by virus-related fears, fear to be infected, fear that some of my relatives get sick, fear not to recognize the symptoms, fear to be unconsciously infected and to unconsciously infect someone.  
During this period I have measured my temperature various times and I have never found high temperatures (the maximum temperature that I've detected is  36.7°C , that's equal to about 98.0/98.1°F). I don't cough, even if there are moments in which I feel myself in a sort of constant expectation of the episod of cough that never arrives: in these occasions I become very nervous and anxious: it's like if the tension over my throat rises and I start to be uncomfortable. The feelings improve when I calm down.  
I have a normal beatrate. I don't have any headache and I don't have nausea, I don't have physical pains.  
The only doubt that sometimes start to obsessively grip my mind is about my throat. I start to experience kind of uncomfortable and unprecise feeling around my throat,  kind of a lump or a general and vague feeling of dryness (even if I'm not sure of this) and I start to get scared, because some experts describe sore throat as a symptom of covid-19.   
There is anyway to say that I don't know if it's possible to tell, in this case, of sore throat, given that during my life it happened, in the past, that I exeperienced sore throat and I remember that in the typical features of sore throat there are a strong necessity to clear the throat and a tendence to have a hoarse voice or raspy voice; in this period I'm not experiencing any of these feelings.  My psychologist said that the throat is a typical somatization zone of the organism.   
But I'm plenty of obsessions: thoughts in my mind are like: ""what if I am underestimating possible covid symptoms? Should I do something?"".

I understand why but I really don't want to be stopped by the police what if I get infected by them?

 I hate being stuck in Greece I hate Greece honestly 

I am in a house alone with my roommate back in Switzerland who eventho i talk to daily I still miss and is one of the reasons why I am going mad.  I feel trapped and alone

I'm already really insecure about my appearance and now I'm stuck with a shit hair colour job that left me with an awful  horizontal strike of bright red between my roots and died Black hair. So I look even more shit than usual 

I really wanted to get a job in some office but now I can't ,and I feel hopeless that I will never since the economy will be fucked

Hi, I'm from Hull in the U.K. and I have been told by my boss, in person, that I will become a furloughed worker, yet I am still required to work for them and get paid my usual monthly wage (not 80%). The company isn't struggling and is still gaining new customers, but they want the grant for the government so have told all their workers to keep it secret. They have even created secret communications and changed names on emails so it isn't traceable.

Of course, this is fraud, and if I am aware of what they are doing and continue to work, I too am partaking in fraudulent activities. This could land me with 10+ years in prison, and HMRC and ACAS have confirmed this.

I am still in my probation period, which means if I say I don't want to do this, they will fire me, if I quit my job, I won't be able to pay rent or support my family, and I also wouldn't be eligible for any kind of benefits as I chose to leave my job.

,COVID19_support,"TLDR: Grandpa and Grandma have passed from Covid-19. My SO is in a country that refuses to quarantine. 

I typed out my post earlier this morning you can see it below this paragraph. I’m too tired to change it. But since this afternoon my grandpa has also passed. My mom has been sobbing throughout the afternoon and she’s feeling terrified. This whole situation is surreal. From dealing with planning a virtual funeral to seeing my grandpa’s body through video feed, it’s just unbelievable. Earlier I was feeling powerless and now I’m just horrified. 

TLDR: My grandma passed away from Covid-19. We are holding a virtual funeral due to quarantine. And my SO has asthma and I’m not coping well. 

My grandparents have never been very close to me/my family. My mom has been estranged from them for the past 4 years. They live in New York and recently contracted Covid-19. We were contacted by my cousin and luckily my mom was able to contact my grandma when she could still talk. My grandparents are/were in their 70s/80s and grandma wasn’t as healthy as my grandpa. Grandpa is still hanging in there but recently my grandma passed away and everything is surreal. Normally we could drive to NYC to help out and handle things. But with the spread of Covid-19 and the state of NYC we can’t go there. My mom couldn’t see grandma in the hospital and can’t see her now that she’s passed. My mom has been calling to set up the funeral but we cannot attend in person. And to add to this surreal feeling the funeral will be live streamed to us and other family members. 

Now that the disease in closer than ever to my family I’m feeling terribly anxious. My SO is in another country that isn’t taking the proper precautions to prevent the virus from spreading. He has to go to work everyday and soon he will be transferred to a rural area right outside of a huge city. He has asthma and I’m petrified. We talk everyday and the thought of the virus just looms in the background of our conversations. We bring it up every once and awhile but the both of us just get silent. It’s terrifying to acknowledge how dangerous Covid-19 is. I feel so powerless and anxious.

Edit: So the virtual funeral was held yesterday. It was as surreal and absurd as we thought it would be. The funeral directors were wearing masks while placing the caskets in the grave. We said last words through a phone conference call. There was no pastor and everything was rushed. The funeral home was so busy they never even processed the second payment for my Grandpa. 

Two days ago we found out where they likely contracted the virus. They had been mostly isolated, and for necessities their carer would buy groceries and leave everything at their door. But despite this effort they still chose to attend church weekly. A few other attending members had contracted covid-19 as well (We had called their family doctor who gave us this information). So this is likely where they got it from. Please urge your loved ones to stay away from large gatherings and keep isolated at home. 

Some happier news, my SO is doing well and  his company has put in new protocols to keep everyone social distancing from one another. The company did this on their own, without and pressure from the government. I feel more at ease.

Also I’m not sure if anyone will see this but shoutout to NYC heath workers, customer service workers, and funeral home workers. You guys were really amazing. There was never a hurtful or cold word said. Despite the situation everyone was unbelievably kind. The nurse in charge of my grandparents tried to accommodate my mom as well as she could despite the danger. The hospital workers who transferred our calls were always so sweet and had said condolences when they heard the news. The man at the security/lost in found counter was so patient and informative as well as kind when we were trying to figure out where my deceased grandparents stuff was.

My mom has been sobbing throughout the afternoon and she’s feeling terrified. This whole situation is surreal. From dealing with planning a virtual funeral to seeing my grandpa’s body through video feed, it’s just unbelievable. Earlier I was feeling powerless and now I’m just horrified. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: My grandma passed away from Covid-19. We are holding a virtual funeral due to quarantine. And my SO has asthma and I’m not coping well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandparents have never been very close to me/my family. My mom has been estranged from them for the past 4 years. They live in New York and recently contracted Covid-19. We were contacted by my cousin and luckily my mom was able to contact my grandma when she could still talk. My grandparents are/were in their 70s/80s and grandma wasn’t as healthy as my grandpa. Grandpa is still hanging in there but recently my grandma passed away and everything is surreal. Normally we could drive to NYC to help out and handle things. But with the spread of Covid-19 and the state of NYC we can’t go there. My mom couldn’t see grandma in the hospital and can’t see her now that she’s passed. My mom has been calling to set up the funeral but we cannot attend in person. And to add to this surreal feeling the funeral will be live streamed to us and other family members. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the disease in closer than ever to my family I’m feeling terribly anxious. My SO is in another country that isn’t taking the proper precautions to prevent the virus from spreading. He has to go to work everyday and soon he will be transferred to a rural area right outside of a huge city. He has asthma and I’m petrified. We talk everyday and the thought of the virus just looms in the background of our conversations. We bring it up every once and awhile but the both of us just get silent. It’s terrifying to acknowledge how dangerous Covid-19 is. I feel so powerless and anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: So the virtual funeral was held yesterday. It was as surreal and absurd as we thought it would be. The funeral directors were wearing masks while placing the caskets in the grave. We said last words through a phone conference call. There was no pastor and everything was rushed. The funeral home was so busy they never even processed the second payment for my Grandpa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days ago we found out where they likely contracted the virus. They had been mostly isolated, and for necessities their carer would buy groceries and leave everything at their door. But despite this effort they still chose to attend church weekly. A few other attending members had contracted covid-19 as well (We had called their family doctor who gave us this information). So this is likely where they got it from. Please urge your loved ones to stay away from large gatherings and keep isolated at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some happier news, my SO is doing well and  his company has put in new protocols to keep everyone social distancing from one another. The company did this on their own, without and pressure from the government. I feel more at ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I’m not sure if anyone will see this but shoutout to NYC heath workers, customer service workers, and funeral home workers. You guys were really amazing. There was never a hurtful or cold word said. Despite the situation everyone was unbelievably kind. The nurse in charge of my grandparents tried to accommodate my mom as well as she could despite the danger. The hospital workers who transferred our calls were always so sweet and had said condolences when they heard the news. The man at the security/lost in found counter was so patient and informative as well as kind when we were trying to figure out where my deceased grandparents stuff was. Really thank you for everything you have done.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"Hey, I’m glad this sub exists. Just looking to get things off my chest in a sense of community honestly. 

When a new coronavirus first started to make appearances on the news here and there, I shrugged it off from my comfy apartment in suburban Japan. I was planning to see my long distance boyfriend in the US soon (where I’m also from), teaching English in public schools, traveling and enjoying a foreign culture and new places every weekend. It was a life I’d worked very hard for and spent my college years dreaming of while saving pennies from my myriad of miserable retail jobs. However, I had decided back in January that since teaching isn’t my passion, I would move back to the states later this year and start a new career (and be closer to loved ones again). 

My work contract would be up this summer, and I’d leave Japan fulfilled with the time I spent there with all the closure I needed.

This month and last, life has gotten darker and darker. Japan has avoided taking a stance on the virus and now it’s catching up. My fellow foreign coworkers find out at work about their friends and family back home being sick or dying. Some of them hop on a plane and leave, others can’t because their home countries are shut down. I don’t want to end up in that situation. 

So today, I sit in my apartment wondering how I’m going to even begin to pack up my life here so abruptly and painfully. The US embassy has made it very clear that staying means risking not coming back this summer - staying indefinitely. I have family. No job waiting for me, but I won’t have one here soon, either. It’s valid and arguable that there will be available and affordable flights in a few months, but I can’t risk it. Not looking for opinions here - I know the US is a shitshow but this is my choice and my work agrees that the risk is high, Japan is rapidly worsening, and the best anyone can hope for right now is to be near to those they love. My family is okay with the risk of me catching it and spreading it to them during travel. 

I can’t say goodbye to my students or most of my friends here because of the virus. No farewell parties or goodbye hugs. I can’t go to my favorite places or eat most of my favorite foods one last time. I just.... leave. Never in a million years did I think I’d leave early or like this 

My bf, who is in the military, might be doing disaster relief soon too. I’m proud of him but damn is that hard to process. We’re in a solid LDR, but I don’t know when I’ll get to see him. My emotions 

I know I don’t have it nearly as bad as others. I’m grateful that I’m healthy, my family is healthy, and that I have a home waiting for me. I’m glad to have the love and support of an amazing partner. I’m glad I’ve had the experiences I’ve had abroad before this started. 

But I’m sad, too. Sad to see my hopes, dreams, and expectations for the year taken away from me. Sad to see the world crumbling. Wondering when I can travel again. I know it’ll happen, I just wish it didn’t have to be like this now.

,COVID19_support,"***Important Preface****: I talk about intrusive suicidal thoughts I've been having in this post, and I describe a pessimistic perspective on my future during the pandemic. I totally understand that this can be harmful to others. Please, if you think that could trigger anxiety or upset you in any way, don't read this. Stay safe!*

Hey guys. This is a sequel of sorts from a post I made a few days ago. That day, I was feeling really anxious and entering an uncomfortable state of thinking. As of today, it hasn’t gotten much better, and I don’t know if it will for a long time.

At this state in the pandemic, my mind’s pretty torn up by everything, and as of the past few days, I’ve been considering my future should things go worst-case. Here’s the thing: like many, my brain’s very sensitive and is struggling to cope with the possibilities of COVID-19. The main thing that’s got me distraught is the idea of losing parents/siblings in the midst of this. 

I’ve seen plenty of stories crammed in my face where a person’s lost various family members to the virus (some young, some old, some with underlying conditions, some with none). I’ve seen absolutely heartbreaking, first-hand accounts on Reddit of people losing family. These stories are becoming too common, and I just have a feeling it’s heading my way. At this point, there’s no guarantee that my family and I will get out of this unscathed, and until there is, I simply cannot assume an optimistic mentality. This could change as we get further into this, but as of now, I just don’t think it’s possible.

With that, the worst-case scenario has been incredibly overwhelming in my head, and I’ve been having suicidal thoughts entering my thoughts, which is in complete contrast to where my mental health was just a few weeks ago. I can’t imagine continuing forward, at the age of 20 in my college years, and dealing with the loss of a parent or sibling in the process. I totally understand we’re not guaranteed tomorrow, and I could be dealing with this situation at any time, but that’s typically not so prevailing in my everyday life.

This fucking pandemic has put that possibility in the front seat, and like a lot of people, losing my parents or siblings this early on is my biggest fear. Growing up, I always did everything to ensure I knew they were safe where they were, whether they were travelling, at work, or just in another room at home.

God, I’m absolutely bawling my eyes out just typing this.

I get that humans are resilient, and that we (usually) find a way in every situation, no matter how devastating, **but I don’t think that’d cut it for me**. I don’t think I could deal with the pain. I’m doing really bad already – before anything’s even happened – and if that ends up being reality, I think that’d be it for me. I just can’t imagine living it – I’m too fragile.

I really, really want a future with my parents where THIS VIRUS isn’t what takes them from me. 

I know all of us do. 

I want them to continue enjoying their lives, too, whether that’s seeing their kids or grand-kids, watching football, fishing on weekends and more. The thought of an empty living space with all their possessions and interests collecting dust because of their death from this fucking virus is already too much for me to cope with. I’m really struggling here. I actually had a panic attack just writing that.

I’ve voiced these concerns to my mom, and told her I was starting to have intrusive suicidal thinking, and honestly -- while I absolutely understood and respected it -- her response didn’t help me too much. It just felt nice to get it out.

 I don’t know what can help me. I’m just heartbroken that I’m even thinking about an early ending if things go that way; it's in absolute contrast with the love for life I had just a few weeks ago. I’m also that my parents – who are at a beautiful point in their lives, could be taken away so soon.

I don't think mourning them before anything's even happened is a good thing. It's unhealthy and unfounded mental preparation. I'm starting to understand that a little more.

**Again, I totally understand death is inevitable; we’ll all encounter it at some point, unfortunately**. But the fact it’s just thrown at us like this is so painful. Please, if you have anything reassuring to offer, I’d really appreciate hearing it. I hope this didn’t come off as selfish. I just don’t know what to do right now. I’m feeling hopeless, and I needed a place to let it out.

,COVID19_support,"Trigger warning for arguments between family members and anger?

How do you cope when you feel like someone is putting you at risk?  I've been fighting with my father near daily lately because I feel like he isn't doing simple things that would help protect us both.  Example: he keeps trying to go to the store for things that are not essential right now, like a replacement bulb for the stove.  Or when we had to go out the other day for food he refused to wear gloves 'because they make his hands sweaty'.  He then fought me on using hand sanitizer after we went to the bank 'because he didn't really touch anything.'  Then proceeded to go through the drive through, touch the bank canister, and then touch the steering wheel of my car.   

I know the risks of surface transmission like that is relatively minimal.  But it makes me so angry because wearing gloves and using sanitizer are such simple, small things.  We got into a huge fight and I told him that it would be one thing if he was only putting himself at risk, but he's risking my life too.  And even more importantly to me, he's putting our cats at risk...if we both get sick, who will take care of them?  He told me he feels like I'm punishing him for not doing what I want.  I told him I feel like he doesn't care about me all that much since sweaty hands are apparently more pressing then my health.  It was a pretty nasty argument.  

The weird part is that he's not generally dismissive of the dangers.  He watches the news and is angry at the way all of this has been handled.

&lt;p&gt;How do you cope when you feel like someone is putting you at risk?  I&amp;#39;ve been fighting with my father near daily lately because I feel like he isn&amp;#39;t doing simple things that would help protect us both.  Example: he keeps trying to go to the store for things that are not essential right now, like a replacement bulb for the stove.  Or when we had to go out the other day for food he refused to wear gloves &amp;#39;because they make his hands sweaty&amp;#39;.  He then fought me on using hand sanitizer after we went to the bank &amp;#39;because he didn&amp;#39;t really touch anything.&amp;#39;  Then proceeded to go through the drive through, touch the bank canister, and then touch the steering wheel of my car.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the risks of surface transmission like that is relatively minimal.  But it makes me so angry because wearing gloves and using sanitizer are such simple, small things.  We got into a huge fight and I told him that it would be one thing if he was only putting himself at risk, but he&amp;#39;s risking my life too.  And even more importantly to me, he&amp;#39;s putting our cats at risk...if we both get sick, who will take care of them?  He told me he feels like I&amp;#39;m punishing him for not doing what I want.  I told him I feel like he doesn&amp;#39;t care about me all that much since sweaty hands are apparently more pressing then my health.  It was a pretty nasty argument.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weird part is that he&amp;#39;s not generally dismissive of the dangers.  He watches the news and is angry at the way all of this has been handled.  Show him a video of someone licking produce or a mass gathering in a church and he gets enraged.  And then he wanders around buying useless light bulbs and touching things.  There&amp;#39;s this massive disconnect between his actions and his emotional response that I don&amp;#39;t know how to handle.  &lt;/p&gt;

My mom has dealt with aortic stenosis her whole life, and had a valve replacement 10 years ago. She is also overweight.

She also says that she made her own hand sanitizer with alcohol and a few other ingredients. She takes off her outer shirt after work which gets the majority of any germs from working. And she is trying to increase her immune system with various supplements.

,COVID19_support,"Well, I was kinda expecting another recession to happen soon, but this is unprecedented. I lost my summer internship, and I'm supposed to graduate in December. My major is Communications, and I'm minoring in Broadcasting. What a great time to be that major, huh? My capstone, which I'm scheduled to take in the Fall and is required to graduate, is to take part in the production of a public-access show. Guess what? It's no longer running for the foreseeable future. All but 1 of my classes for next semester are hands on, practicum style courses that I don't see being able to be taught online.

My school has been completely uncommunicative with me, and now I'm wondering if I'll even be able to graduate. My motivation for every class has just dropped, and I've started drinking a lot more. If I do graduate, I'm going to be competing with every other person who lost their jobs recently. As a result of losing the internship, my resumé is going to be pretty barren as far as experience goes. I feel like how I felt when I first dropped out of college, but worse. I feel that I'm going to be living with my parents until I'm 30 while working for the grocery store I worked at in high school, driving/delivering for Uber, or god forbid, the Amazon warehouse. I've had really bad ankles as a result of a dozen corrective surgeries for club feet, and I had to quit my last grocery store job because I ruptured my achilles tendon, so I'm getting my degree so I don't have to make a living fucking up my ankles. Amazon sucks as a company regardless and I'd rather start selling drugs again than work for them, that's besides the point though. However, the thought of doing that kind of work and not being able to walk when I'm older because of it is much more tangible now, especially with this worthless degree which I only took because it was easy and my dad found success with it.

Luckily, I have money saved and I won't graduate with debt, but I really feel fucked in terms of my future college career and the future job market. As a result of my ""cushy"" financial situation, I am ineligible for a stimulus check and have to resort to mooching off my parents (who both worked from home before covid and will still continue to). I know I wasn't going to be making 50k a year out of college with this degree, but I expected to be in something better than wageslave retail or unreliable gig/contract work. This pandemic is making me rethink every decision I've ever made about college and how they were all wrong. I now think that I should've just fucking learned a trade like everyone else in my neighborhood.

This pandemic has also made me lose faith in the US government completely. Our politicians (on both sides) are so out of touch that they may as well live in a different country than us. These old pricks in DC have really shown all of us that even in times of crisis, nothing will make them give a fuck about their constituents. I'm just worried that this pandemic is going to happen again in the future due to the complete lack of food safety and the practice of illegal animal poaching in China, and that it's going to be much worse. China immediately went back to allowing wet markets right after the first SARS outbreak, and who will stop them from opening them again come summer? 

So what's the point of all of this? In the past week, I've had 2 neighbors taken from their homes in ambulances, and I saw the aftermath of a woman's suicide when she jumped from the parking garage at the hospital after losing a loved one. 2 employees of my local Wal-Mart have died today. People are giving their lives for soulless corporations who won't even pay them a living wage. All day, all I can hear are sirens. A good friend of mine who lives in another city was just diagnosed with the virus today. I haven't slept for more than 4 hours in the past two weeks.

&lt;p&gt;This pandemic has also made me lose faith in the US government completely. Our politicians (on both sides) are so out of touch that they may as well live in a different country than us. These old pricks in DC have really shown all of us that even in times of crisis, nothing will make them give a fuck about their constituents. I&amp;#39;m just worried that this pandemic is going to happen again in the future due to the complete lack of food safety and the practice of illegal animal poaching in China, and that it&amp;#39;s going to be much worse. China immediately went back to allowing wet markets right after the first SARS outbreak, and who will stop them from opening them again come summer? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the point of all of this? In the past week, I&amp;#39;ve had 2 neighbors taken from their homes in ambulances, and I saw the aftermath of a woman&amp;#39;s suicide when she jumped from the parking garage at the hospital after losing a loved one. 2 employees of my local Wal-Mart have died today. People are giving their lives for soulless corporations who won&amp;#39;t even pay them a living wage. All day, all I can hear are sirens. A good friend of mine who lives in another city was just diagnosed with the virus today. I haven&amp;#39;t slept for more than 4 hours in the past two weeks. I can&amp;#39;t take it much more of this, and I don&amp;#39;t know if I want to live in the aftermath of this.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19_support,"I've had soreness in my chest for about a week. Normally, I would have already gone to an Urgent Care to get it checked out, but I'm too anxious to leave my house, let alone arrange a trip to a medical facility (I don't have a car). I spoke on the phone to a doctor who said it might be costochondritis, but that she wouldn't be able to diagnose without seeing me in person. I keep seeing horror stories about people who seemed otherwise okay, but actually had COVID lung damage. Or people who have inflammation in their heart (my pain is on the left side).

Would appreciate any support or methods to calm down my health anxiety.

For context, I had a cough for about two weeks that disappeared around the time the chest pain appeared, but my fever was never over 100. Is it possible to have major lung or heart damage without a fever? I'm so freaked.

,COVID19_support,"My local grocery stores are all really overwhelmed with delivery orders so I need to go out for food here and there. They have taped the sidewalk so that everyone on line stands 6 feet apart from each other, but it’s not enforced in the store at all.

I want to go on grocery runs for my grandmother and I, but she wants to go to the store with me bc she’s tired of being in our apartment for so long. We go out once a week on average. She is 58ish years old (you try asking grandma her age), and she doesn’t live the healthiest lifestyle so I worry about her. She also has asthma. 

Obviously I’d prefer she stay in the apt, but I can’t actually stop her from leaving. She knows that COVID-19 is serious and we do try to take small precautions. We have a policy to lysol the bottoms of our shoes before placing them onto a designated mat by the front door, and we wash our hands before touching anything else in the apartment. 

Is that enough? What else can I do to look out for my grandma and I?
