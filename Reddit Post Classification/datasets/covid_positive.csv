,COVID19positive,"A lot of people have been asking me what I've been feeling and I've been wanted to tell others what this illness reminds me of but I've been hesitant to say.

But 17 days out, I'm going come out and say that I struggled with and opioid addiction years back. I was abusing a drug called Opana or oxymorphone (different than oxycodone) and I don't know if the drug is even prescribed anymore.

I cold turkey'd Opana because my doctor refused to continue prescribing it. I did not go to any detox center and decided to white knuckle it at home.

I'll never forgot how sick I felt for the first 10 or so days.

**The Similarities:**

- The pain was intense. I would constantly have to take hot showers and even epsom salt baths. After a few days, it lessened but no matter the lack of energy, I had to take hot showers and ibuprofen. This checks out with COVID 19 except I'm taking paracetamol instead of ibuprofen. In both cases, the pain made it really difficult to sleep. There was no such thing as a ""comfortable position"".

- The hot and cold sweats were intense and extremely uncomfortable. Same with COVID 19. I never checked my temperature while I was going through withdrawal but the it felt the same as COVID 19. The room is too hot, you put a fan on you, it's too cold. This also happened mostly at night when you're trying to sleep making it very difficult to actually fall asleep.

- In both cases, sleep is downright strange. I remember not being able to describe the dreams during Opana withdrawal. Sometimes just scrambled words, terrifying, and I'd wake up, try to find a comfortable position and try to drift back to sleep. In the 17 day after testing positive, there have been times when I couldn't get back to sleep. My doctor treating me via telehealth gave me the OK to take benadryl to fall asleep and it's helped.

- There were days when I felt pretty ok. With Covid 19, the pain subsided after some pretty rough days and I thought it was over. It wasn't. Symptoms have gone and came back and that feels very discouraging. 

- My lack of energy, motivation, interest and overall depression. Sometimes when I can't sleep, I'll try to watch something on Netflix but it's basically background noise. You pay attention the plot for 5 minutes and then lose it. This was so similar to my opioid withdrawal. I am predisposed to depression, however, I was doing well before being infected. 

In addition to that, self-quarantining is difficult because my mother would help me during withdrawal, but I'm completely alone of course. None of my other family were infected. It's a lonely experience.

- Not eating or wanting to eat. This was consistent with opioid withdrawal except for one thing, opioid withdrawal gave me the runs whether I ate or not, and with COVID 19, I haven't experienced any noticeable GI issues.

I'm not hungry, I have no interest in eating, and my sense of smell and taste are no longer completely gone, but still not as strong as they were before. I still force myself to eat but not having the runs is a major plus because I haven't had to worry about dehydration.

- Impending sense of doom. So this may go along with the depression and losing motivation and being depressed but there is a certain feeling and you would have had to feel it before to understand it. It really hit me hard with opiod withdrawal, but it's definitely here and there with COVID 19. It's a strange sensation to experience, it's not something you want to experience, but in those moments, everything just feels dark, everything is meaningless, you think about your friends and family, your dreams and aspirations, and everything prior to this just feels grim and that's the best way I can describe this feeling. It's fleeting but still there, moreso now at day 17 than in the beginning.

**What is different:**

- As I mentioned, I had the runs with opioid withdrawal. This would be sooo much suckier if I had to worry about dehydration during this. I still make sure I'm hydrated of course.

- There's no ""craving"" for anything. There were days where I'd think it would be nice to have a painkiller right now, but I know it would complicate the matters. The pain isn't serious enough for a relapse, it just sucks. Hot showers and epsom salt baths AND MY HEATING PAD have been godsends.

- There weren't any respiratory problems with opiod withdrawal. My breathing is stable right now, but there was a point where I couldn't walk down the hall without feeling winded and that's when I realized I needed to get tested. I have to do a certain breathing exercise (not deep breathing) that requires me to lie on my stomach.

- Oh yeah, I didn't have to lie on my stomach for opioid withdrawal. This was suggested in the first days. I could lie on my side when I slept but was advised to lie on my stomach when relaxing.

I don't know if this helps anyone. My case was considered mild. I use a pulsometer to make sure my oxygen levels are normal and I'm doing much better. I'm in contact with my doctor and I've avoided reading others experiences. I always found that it could make symptoms worse, or make symptoms I didn't have suddenly ""happen"".

The last 3 days, I haven't had a fever and that ""technically"" means I'm ready to be tested again, and the virus should no longer be in my body but my doctor advised an additional 2 weeks of self-quarantining because of the lingering symptoms.

I think there will be an end when I'm fully recovered but for a case that's been considered mild, it's been a tough time. I know opioid withdrawal has NOTHING to do with Covid-19, but it was the closest experience I could compare it to. I've had the common cold, influenza, strep throat, but I have to say that this has been the hardest for me.

But if anyone watched Chris Cuomo on CNN when he was kind of documenting his experience, he kept saying how lucky he felt. Not really a fan of Chris Cuomo but he was right about certain things. This isn't the flu, nights (or whenever you can get to sleep) are when it's the worst, and I do feel lucky because maybe this could have killed me if I didn't act sooner. I was the only in my family was infected, I'm praying I didn't infect anyone else.

**DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AND STILL GOT THE VIRUS:**

I was isolating since March. I GET that I'm in NY but I took this incredibly seriously from the get go. I live alone with my cats in an apartment building, I didn't touch rails, I sanitized after touching door knobs or anything outside (while taking the garbage out or getting the mail), I used a grocery DELIVERY service where they bought the bags to my door without any contact. I wiped down EVERYTHING including my mail. I door-dashed with no contact (they give you the option). Wiped everything down just incase.

**Where I could have gone wrong:**

Walmart - I used a service called RXpay hoping they would bring my medication to me in my car and they could just scan my phone. In fact, the pharmacist told me I could do this. NOPE! I get there and they tell me I have to come pay inside. They couldn't bring the scanner outside. I was somewhat prepared but not with a proper mask. Let me tell you something, this April 4th, and couples and families were still going in together. This was right after our governor said you had to wear a some sort of face covering in public. I'd say half weren't. Social distancing? There was a lady at the entrance offering sanitized carts, GREAT! What wasn't great is that the lady was holding up a line of people who weren't respecting personal space or the markers on the ground that marked 6 feet. I go in with sunglasses, and a scarf, I'm on this ridiculous line and the guy in front of me turns around and yells to his girlfriend outside, ""WE DON'T NEED A CART! ... A CART!"" Jesus f'ing Christ. 

The guy yelled right into my face. Of course he didn't have a mask. I finally get in, the pharmacy seems to have things in check, they have a visor and everything, they scanned my phone, handed me my meds and I was out of there. But Walmart decided to put these stupid automatic gates that you could only enter through and stupid me, I'm trying to get out of the store ASAP, and I'm literally having a panic attack and walk up to the gate where you can't leave. I don't know Walmart's new layout, I don't go in there. PERIOD. I was prescribed a new med that CVS didn't have stock of. But yeah, I walk into this gate and the greeter is just staring at me? And I'm like, ""How do I get out?!"" I was panicked and overreacting a LITTLE, considering I had to go in there in the first place. So you have to walk around those stupid little gates THAT HAVE NO REAL PURPOSE RIGHT NOW and exit where you check out.

In my opinion, Wal Mart was the ONLY way I could have contracted this virus and it pisses me off so badly that I don't actually know. If it was that guy that decided to turn around and invade my personal space, man...

I posted about it on our county's Facebook group (YES, some people have FB in 2020, it's still absolutely terrible but useful at times) and others had the same experience at this Walmart.

Out of all the non-metro/city counties, mine had the highest count. And my city still has the highest count. I may be doxxing myself but if you know where in NY I'm talking about it, you'll know how our city is. The mayor of our county (R) is hyped about re-opening. I've written to Cuomo's office and have heard nothing.

It&amp;#39;s fleeting but still there, moreso now at day 17 than in the beginning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is different:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I had the runs with opioid withdrawal. This would be sooo much suckier if I had to worry about dehydration during this. I still make sure I&amp;#39;m hydrated of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;craving&amp;quot; for anything. There were days where I&amp;#39;d think it would be nice to have a painkiller right now, but I know it would complicate the matters. The pain isn&amp;#39;t serious enough for a relapse, it just sucks. Hot showers and epsom salt baths AND MY HEATING PAD have been godsends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;#39;t any respiratory problems with opiod withdrawal. My breathing is stable right now, but there was a point where I couldn&amp;#39;t walk down the hall without feeling winded and that&amp;#39;s when I realized I needed to get tested. I have to do a certain breathing exercise (not deep breathing) that requires me to lie on my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I didn&amp;#39;t have to lie on my stomach for opioid withdrawal. This was suggested in the first days. I could lie on my side when I slept but was advised to lie on my stomach when relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this helps anyone. My case was considered mild. I use a pulsometer to make sure my oxygen levels are normal and I&amp;#39;m doing much better. I&amp;#39;m in contact with my doctor and I&amp;#39;ve avoided reading others experiences. I always found that it could make symptoms worse, or make symptoms I didn&amp;#39;t have suddenly &amp;quot;happen&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 3 days, I haven&amp;#39;t had a fever and that &amp;quot;technically&amp;quot; means I&amp;#39;m ready to be tested again, and the virus should no longer be in my body but my doctor advised an additional 2 weeks of self-quarantining because of the lingering symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there will be an end when I&amp;#39;m fully recovered but for a case that&amp;#39;s been considered mild, it&amp;#39;s been a tough time. I know opioid withdrawal has NOTHING to do with Covid-19, but it was the closest experience I could compare it to. I&amp;#39;ve had the common cold, influenza, strep throat, but I have to say that this has been the hardest for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if anyone watched Chris Cuomo on CNN when he was kind of documenting his experience, he kept saying how lucky he felt. Not really a fan of Chris Cuomo but he was right about certain things. This isn&amp;#39;t the flu, nights (or whenever you can get to sleep) are when it&amp;#39;s the worst, and I do feel lucky because maybe this could have killed me if I didn&amp;#39;t act sooner. I was the only in my family was infected, I&amp;#39;m praying I didn&amp;#39;t infect anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AND STILL GOT THE VIRUS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was isolating since March. I GET that I&amp;#39;m in NY but I took this incredibly seriously from the get go. I live alone with my cats in an apartment building, I didn&amp;#39;t touch rails, I sanitized after touching door knobs or anything outside (while taking the garbage out or getting the mail), I used a grocery DELIVERY service where they bought the bags to my door without any contact. I wiped down EVERYTHING including my mail. I door-dashed with no contact (they give you the option). Wiped everything down just incase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where I could have gone wrong:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walmart - I used a service called RXpay hoping they would bring my medication to me in my car and they could just scan my phone. In fact, the pharmacist told me I could do this. NOPE! I get there and they tell me I have to come pay inside. They couldn&amp;#39;t bring the scanner outside. I was somewhat prepared but not with a proper mask. Let me tell you something, this April 4th, and couples and families were still going in together. This was right after our governor said you had to wear a some sort of face covering in public. I&amp;#39;d say half weren&amp;#39;t. Social distancing? There was a lady at the entrance offering sanitized carts, GREAT! What wasn&amp;#39;t great is that the lady was holding up a line of people who weren&amp;#39;t respecting personal space or the markers on the ground that marked 6 feet. I go in with sunglasses, and a scarf, I&amp;#39;m on this ridiculous line and the guy in front of me turns around and yells to his girlfriend outside, &amp;quot;WE DON&amp;#39;T NEED A CART! ... A CART!&amp;quot; Jesus f&amp;#39;ing Christ. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy yelled right into my face. Of course he didn&amp;#39;t have a mask. I finally get in, the pharmacy seems to have things in check, they have a visor and everything, they scanned my phone, handed me my meds and I was out of there. But Walmart decided to put these stupid automatic gates that you could only enter through and stupid me, I&amp;#39;m trying to get out of the store ASAP, and I&amp;#39;m literally having a panic attack and walk up to the gate where you can&amp;#39;t leave. I don&amp;#39;t know Walmart&amp;#39;s new layout, I don&amp;#39;t go in there. PERIOD. I was prescribed a new med that CVS didn&amp;#39;t have stock of. But yeah, I walk into this gate and the greeter is just staring at me? And I&amp;#39;m like, &amp;quot;How do I get out?!&amp;quot; I was panicked and overreacting a LITTLE, considering I had to go in there in the first place. So you have to walk around those stupid little gates THAT HAVE NO REAL PURPOSE RIGHT NOW and exit where you check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Wal Mart was the ONLY way I could have contracted this virus and it pisses me off so badly that I don&amp;#39;t actually know. If it was that guy that decided to turn around and invade my personal space, man...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted about it on our county&amp;#39;s Facebook group (YES, some people have FB in 2020, it&amp;#39;s still absolutely terrible but useful at times) and others had the same experience at this Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all the non-metro/city counties, mine had the highest count. And my city still has the highest count. I may be doxxing myself but if you know where in NY I&amp;#39;m talking about it, you&amp;#39;ll know how our city is. The mayor of our county (R) is hyped about re-opening. I&amp;#39;ve written to Cuomo&amp;#39;s office and have heard nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for letting me say my part, if you got this thing, you truly are in my thoughts, no B.S. Write me. I could use a pen pal right now!&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been sick for months, and I’ve been in this place with you for so long. My heart goes out to all of you...this SUCKS. For real. 

Here’s just a few things that have helped me get through:

1) The anxiety is real, but sometimes it’s truly the virus. Have a plan for who to call and what to do that comforts you when you have a flare. (Weighted blankets, baths, music, breathing exercises, a good cry...We even adopted a dog once I could get out of bed a little, huge help!)

2) Don’t stop asking for help. If your doctor blows you off, get a second opinion. Get familiar with your insurance and your options. Ask other people who they saw. Go to the ER, the urgent care, the specialist. You KNOW when you’re sick. Get help, fight for it if you have to. There are people who will listen, but they might not be the first doctor you meet with. Keep asking!! 

3) Put your Devil Wears Prada attitude on when new symptoms come up, you feel sicker, or you flare. You’re a boss, take stock of what’s happening with control, don’t let those fear voices overwhelm you. Make a plan. Be the voice of reason for yourself, or find someone who can be (thanks to my scientist husband for doing this for me). 

4) Be kind to yourself. This might be over soon, or you may need more time to recover. It’s okay to take it. Take the time you need. Write yourself permission slips to do what you need to get well. 

The truth is, if you’re hoping for a quick fix, you’re going to crumble. 

That’s ok, it’s ok to let yourself feel sad or pissed and grieve how hard this is. 

It may take a while. But you’re going to be okay. 

It’s ok to let go of that “14 day” recovery. To put down that expectation to bounce back quickly, I promise you’re not a disappointment or a failure. Your body isn’t an enemy. It’s trying hard to help you. 

For those of you who are on this long suffering journey, know that you’re not alone. Chime in the comments, support each other. Get off WebMD and the news and talk to real people.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who is able to share their experiences, this is something that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to get any coverage in the media so I&amp;#39;m very interested to hear from people.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Hello! I am not positive myself, however I have noticed the large amount of plasma donation posts, and I wanted to offer some tips as a long time donor. 

I haven’t donated plasma in months, but I was a regular donor for a few years prior. 

Expect a large needle, and about an 30 min - 1 hr long donation. The overall process is nearly painless. Additionally, unlike blood, the saline solution keeps you hydrated and feeling great throughout the process. I felt so much worse after a 10-20 minute blood donation than I did after a plasma donation. 

Drink lots of water the day of donation, makes it much easier and faster. If possible lift weights prior to the donation to get your blood pumping. Use a stress ball to pump your fist during donation or else your hand may get tired. Some weird feelings during the donation, but continue to pump your fist as needed, and relax during the return processes. At the end, there will be a saline solution added, so expect slight chills and a weird taste in your mouth. If anything ever feels weird or hurts, talk to a worker and they will gladly help. Keep the bandages on and tight for approx 3 hrs to be safe. 

You might feel a bit weird after, but like I said, not nearly as bad as after a blood donation. I regularly worked 10 hr days, followed by a plasma donation and a 3 mile bike ride home. 

Overall, very simple process that can be a bit scary the first time. However, I do not want anything I said to deter you, it is a great way you are helping, and the process is easier than it seems. Listen to music, watch a show on your phone, and the donation will be done before you know it! (Just make sure to pump/relax as needed)

Lost my sense of smell, my sense of taste. Currently I'm feeling mostly alright, but occasionally I have days where I am just... **tired.** My breathing is a bit off as well on some days.

,COVID19positive,"Just thought I'd share my symptoms since my experience wasn't nearly as bad as a lot of others who've posted on here. 

April 10th, started getting a sporatic dry cough. Didn't think much of it and felt mostly ok otherwise other than maybe a little tired. 

April 11th, woke up with a fever, bad aches and fatigue. That lasted through April 13th.

April 14th, aches started to go away but I developed a really awful headache. Still had a low grade fever

April 17th headache subsided but I developed bad eye pain. I started to lose sense of taste and smell around here too. Still had a low grade fever. I got tested on this day at a drive through testing center doing saliva tests.

April 19th, eye pain subsided but woke up with a rash on my legs and arms. Around here my lungs started to feel ""irritated"". It wasn't difficult to breath, but I could tell my lungs were inflamed. Still had low grade fever. Result came back positive from test on 17th. 

April 21st, my lungs were the worst this day. Still had no difficulty breathing but they were very inflamed and it would make me cough if I took a deep breath. Rash also spread to my torso and a little on my face. Still had a low grade fever. 

April 22nd, my body must have gotten a hold of itself and I woke almost all better. Lungs were very minimally irritated and rash was almost all gone. First day with a temp below 99. 

April 23rd, lungs still didn't feel 100% but I was otherwise feeling healthy. Fever did not come back after this and lungs slowly got better over the course of a few days. 


Overall the experience was miserable, but manageable, like any cold I've had, just longer. I work from home and there was only one day I wasn't able to work at all. I only took Tylenol for pain and fever reduction, and only needed to take it through the first half of the illness. 

I have two roommates, one never got symptoms, the other got a phlegmy cough and some fatigue for a few days. The roommate with the cough tested positive for it after I did. We weren't really isolating from each other since we live in a small apartment and didn't really have a choice. 

I also got an antibody test done on May 4th because I want to donate plasma, which came back negative. Though I've since been reading about how unreliable the current antibody tests are. I may try to get retested in another week to see if I can donate plasma. 

Ask whatever questions you'd like. I hope my symptoms can show people who are worried that it's not always as bad as some of the other posts on here.

Edit: Dates are not exact other than start and finish.

Edit2: sense of smell and taste came back a day to two after the 23rd.

Supplements taken before and during: vit D, Iron, l-citrulline, folic acid, magnesium glycinate, cordyceps, b complex, zinc

Supplements added during: vit C, rhodiola rosea, turmeric capsule, make ginger tea throughout the day

Extra Notes:

&amp;#x200B;

\-  TESTING: I tested negative for COVID-19 about 3 weeks in but was presumed positive by a doc via tele-call, and tested negative for antibodies between weeks 4 and 5

\- FAMILY: My dad was never tested, but a day after my symptoms began, he was hit with 103-104 fevers, night sweats, exhaustion, the whole nine. The initial symptoms happed over the course of 14 days, and he has made a full recovery over the course of 4 weeks. My stepmother and stepsister have been exposed to him on a consistent basis since the beginning and neither have had any symptoms

\- NICOTINE &amp; KRATOM: I stopped using my juul April 1st. When things began to feel better during weeks 2 and 3, I began to vape small amounts (a pull or 2 a day) just to lessen the withdrawals but feared that it was making lung symptoms worse. I’ve switched over to nicotine gum while I continue to battle this. I’ve lessened the amount of kratom that I take but continue to take it daily.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My symptoms started on March 30th. It was a Monday night and I began feeling some light SOB that would continue into Tuesday night. I wasn’t sure if it was a symptom or all just in my head, so I chalked it up to just being anxious. Wednesday night, April 1st, a slew of symptoms began. As I was on the cusp of sleep, I had this weird feeling that someone was standing behind me, as if I “sensed” their presence. This isn’t abnormal, as I’ve had hypnogogic hallucinations when I’m about to fall asleep my whole life and I can always brush them off. This time, this feeling sparked a genuine sense of fear which shot my body right up out of bed. Within 5 minutes, I was sweating, quickly alternated between cold and hot, felt this tingling sensation that would travel up and down my body as if I was being pricked by tiny needles in waves, and I just felt mentally aloof. The best word I could use to describe the mental aloofness is goofy. I just felt like a giant goofball. I also had a low-grade fever of about 99.2-99.5. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the next 7 days, I would experience sweats, chills, aloofness, tiredness, and lethargic. It was weird, during this period everything seemed brighter and my pupils were dilated. I’ve had a few psychedelic experiences, and a low dose/microdose of shrooms is the closest thing that I can compare my perception to during this period. After the first week, SOB, the sensation of movement in my lungs, and chest tightness would be the main symptoms over the next 2 weeks. The initial chills and sweats subsided, and aside from the lung symptoms, I felt mentally spry, energetic, and like I was moving in the right direction. I was handling chores, playing games, and making music like normal. However, my lungs continued to feel weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the 21st night, I was hit with the same symptoms I experienced on April 1st, with about 80%-90% of the intensity of the first time. It was an odd night, my shortness of breath would intensify for a few minutes, then disappear as if my breathing was perfect, then intensify again while my body continued to get chills and my brain continued to get foggy. After that night, I had another week of battling those symptoms that I thought I was through with after the first week. It wasn’t pleasant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Monday (3 days from now) will make three weeks since that 2nd wave. Within the past week and a half, my shortness breath has been present in varying intensities, and I’ve developed small aches in my sides, arms, and legs. I’ve also been dealing with EXTREME fatigue. It’ll be 2-3 hours waves of tiredness that feels like I’m tired in every single fiber of my being down to my atoms. This fatigue usually comes with a sense of impending doom as feeling that tired just can’t be ok. Simply holding my phone up for 10+ seconds would feel as if I just did a few reps of weightlifting. My pulse has been on the higher side, resting in the high 90s and If I stand up it’ll jump up to 115. I’ve also had these small aches that come every 30min to 1hr that feels like it’s happening in my heart. They’re concerning for sure, but don’t feel major at this point, and I hope they remain that way.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I had fatigue early on, but I made an effort to get up and be in the sun for a bit and that seems to be the most impactful decision I’ve made throughout this whole thing. It was energizing being in its glow, which I didn’t expect being that I’ve been taking vitamin D daily for over 2 years. Last night wasn’t too bad. It felt like another wave was coming but it never arrived. Today my SOB has been minimal; unnoticeable at times, my energy has moments of being low, but has been pretty good throughout. The heart sensation has been happening at the same rate but seems to subside or lessen in intensity if I drink a good bit of water. On the bright side, my pulse has been consistently in the high 70s or low 80s and this is the closest to feeling normal that I’ve felt in a while. I feel like I’m moving in the right direction, but I am refraining from excitement, as I’ve felt good before, and have gotten hit with another wave, and I don’t know if or when that will happen again. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole experience has been mentally and physically exhausting. I’m currently on day 39 and I just want to feel normal again.  I’ve been glued to this subreddit the past couple of weeks, and I’m ready to be sick for a greater period of time if necessary. But like others have said, I need to know that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. We just won’t know until or if we reach the end. This subreddit has been both incredibly reassuring and anxiety-inducing at the same time. While I fear for what may be to come, it’s helpful knowing that what each us are experiencing is real although it’s not a part of the mainstream narrative. I wish the best for those going through this for a longer, more intense period of time.

I was handling chores, playing games, and making music like normal. However, my lungs continued to feel weird. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 21st night, I was hit with the same symptoms I experienced on April 1st, with about 80%-90% of the intensity of the first time. It was an odd night, my shortness of breath would intensify for a few minutes, then disappear as if my breathing was perfect, then intensify again while my body continued to get chills and my brain continued to get foggy. After that night, I had another week of battling those symptoms that I thought I was through with after the first week. It wasn’t pleasant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday (3 days from now) will make three weeks since that 2nd wave. Within the past week and a half, my shortness breath has been present in varying intensities, and I’ve developed small aches in my sides, arms, and legs. I’ve also been dealing with EXTREME fatigue. It’ll be 2-3 hours waves of tiredness that feels like I’m tired in every single fiber of my being down to my atoms. This fatigue usually comes with a sense of impending doom as feeling that tired just can’t be ok. Simply holding my phone up for 10+ seconds would feel as if I just did a few reps of weightlifting. My pulse has been on the higher side, resting in the high 90s and If I stand up it’ll jump up to 115. I’ve also had these small aches that come every 30min to 1hr that feels like it’s happening in my heart. They’re concerning for sure, but don’t feel major at this point, and I hope they remain that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had fatigue early on, but I made an effort to get up and be in the sun for a bit and that seems to be the most impactful decision I’ve made throughout this whole thing. It was energizing being in its glow, which I didn’t expect being that I’ve been taking vitamin D daily for over 2 years. Last night wasn’t too bad. It felt like another wave was coming but it never arrived. Today my SOB has been minimal; unnoticeable at times, my energy has moments of being low, but has been pretty good throughout. The heart sensation has been happening at the same rate but seems to subside or lessen in intensity if I drink a good bit of water. On the bright side, my pulse has been consistently in the high 70s or low 80s and this is the closest to feeling normal that I’ve felt in a while. I feel like I’m moving in the right direction, but I am refraining from excitement, as I’ve felt good before, and have gotten hit with another wave, and I don’t know if or when that will happen again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole experience has been mentally and physically exhausting. I’m currently on day 39 and I just want to feel normal again.  I’ve been glued to this subreddit the past couple of weeks, and I’m ready to be sick for a greater period of time if necessary. But like others have said, I need to know that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. We just won’t know until or if we reach the end. This subreddit has been both incredibly reassuring and anxiety-inducing at the same time. While I fear for what may be to come, it’s helpful knowing that what each us are experiencing is real although it’s not a part of the mainstream narrative. I wish the best for those going through this for a longer, more intense period of time. Thank you, and I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"37/male/6 feet 220lbs (now 205)/no major diagnosed pre-existing conditions/rarely get sick/southeast Virginia

I believe on or about 3.13.2020 I contracted covid.  I was hit with minor symptoms on 3.17.2020.  This included scratchy throat and shortness of breath.  On 3.22.2020 I developed more symptoms. By 3.24.2020 it was worse and by 3.27.2020 I could no longer work from home.  The symptoms included diarrhea, headache, nausea (did not vomit), muscle aches, kidney pain, tightness in chest, fever, chills, sweats, night terrors, hallucinations, insomnia, and I may be missing a few.  One interesting note, I did not have a cough.  I toughed this out for days.. I stayed in bed and forced myself to eat crackers, soup, and juice.  I live alone so mentally this is rough. On about 3.30.2020 I was feeling better and though I was on the mend.  The next day that hope was knocked out of me.  On 4.2.2020 I did a telemedicine.  They prescribed me a z-pak.   My primary care physician was unavailable and the group he was with said he was no longer my pcp because I hadn't seen him in 3 years.  Oh he's been my doc since I was 3.  So telemedicine it is as no one is accepting new patients. By 4.3.2020 I am worse, telemedicine prescribed me an inhaler.  I have hit a point over the past few days where I could sleep.  The grim reaper comes every night looking for me and the dreams are horrid.  But my chest tightness has evolved.  At this point insomnia has kicked in. Right when I try to go to sleep when I am almost there, I gasp for air. Instantly I am awake. Disregard the 10mg of melatonin and the Tylenol pm, I am awake.  I can't live like this so on 4.4.2020 at 4 am I go to the emergency room. My oximeter shows 97 but my blood pressure is like 240/110 or something.  I get x-rays and blood done over the next 10 hours. X-ray shows pneumonia bottom left lung near heart.  My blood is fairly normal. The doctor says the pneumonia isn't bad. The ekg is normal and my glucose is 117 likely because of the halls vitamin c drops? D-dimer was not measured. Wbc was 5.8 rbc was 5.65.. I have all these records and everything appeared to be within spec.  Essentially, the doctor said this is all common we aren't going to test you because your young, healthy, no pre existing conditions and the test is bullshit... but you are presumed covid. Go home.. and for your stomach here is some probiotics, and some benedryl for sleep.  Since you are already on the z pac just continue God speed. This was actually nicest doctor I dealt with. And she talked to my parents on speaker phone with me.  So I was able to get a little sleep after leaving the ER.  The next day I still felt like garbage.  So I phone the telemedicine folks.  I explained to them I had minor pneumonia and they being in NYC prescribed my hydroxychloroquine and phone it into my local Walgreens. Donald Trump's miracle drug is going to save me and the pharmacy filled it.  Thank god!  Not fucking exactly. So I started taking the hcq the same day I finished the z pac.  Now I already felt that my heart was acting funny but at this point I was desperate.  I had given my parents and bro all my bank account information and logins to this and that. I mean I honestly didn't think I was going to make. Now I go to the ER a second time.. the heart palpitations and the chest tightness are something I've never experienced. I am extremely exhausted and still feel on the verge of death. On 4.8.2020 to the er around 1 or 2 am in the morning.  The x-ray now shows little to no sign of pneumonia.  This is great! Although still not sure why I didnt get a CT scan. My glucose is high but everything else is fine.  Wbc is at 6 and rbc is at 5.53. cbc all appear within range. My EKG is normal.  I swear something is wrong with me and I am not crazy.  I am hustled out after the tests are completed. Oxi was 96 doesn't need fluids good to go.  I still feel like death.  I go home and start sucking it up.  I finally start to have a small appetite and can focus a little bit. Re-watched 9 seasons of Seinfeld.  My parents and I play jeapordy and wheel of Fortune on speaker phone.  On 4.16.2020 I was able to have a telehealth with my pcp.  He told me to go get a test now if I could find one.  Testing here was shut down in March but I was able to find an urgent care that did drive by testing.  I waited in my car feeling like ass for 3 hours and made it around the building and was told to come inside.  Wtf? I don't want to go inside.  So I go inside and a nurse jabs me with brain probes in both nostrils.  This is unpleasant but shit I've seen death who gives a damn.  Then she says wait here, the doctor will be in to see you..  so as I am waiting all I hear is coughing and coughing horrible coughing. 20 minutes of this waiting behind the door.  Then some foreign dude is making jokes saying maybe is the corona laughing about it.  The fuck happens to be the doctor.  I move as far away as I can when he opens the door and say dude I am just hear for the test my pcp told me to come in.  So this was a taxing day for me.  I am still not 50% and get knocked back to about 40% on 4.17.2020.  this is my next ER visit. This doc was a dick. Glucose is still high 130. Boarder line EKG which I don't know what that means. No more evidence of pneumonia per radiology. They literally kick me out the side door very disoriented. I suck it up for another day but still don't see a light at the end of the tunnel.  These symptoms are brutal.  On 4.19.2020 I drive 40 minutes to a different emergency room.   Again this doctor is an ass.  No compassion. I inform her I have had these symptoms for over a month but just tested negative.  Meaning the test already sucks and waiting 30 days to be able to get a test doesn't make it suck less. So now she thinks I have mono or some anxiety disorder.  She calls me difficult as she walks out of my room because I am grilling  her with questions. she dismissed my new covid toes and was like whatever.  These people are not educated I have been reading about this shit for over a month. My metabolic is fine except 105 glucose.  My tsh (thyroid) comes back at 7.96. This is new and not in line.  My wbc is 5.6 and my rbc is 5.68.  hgb is 16.2. d-dimer is .47.  my EKG was normal.  So I continue to have all these symptoms for days and days.  It feels like Mike Tyson has punch me in the kidneys.  my final er visit is on 4.22.2020. chest x-ray looks normal, EKG is normal,  troponin 8ng/L,. Wbc 5.0, rbc 5.46, hgb 15.9, and d-dimer .49 mg/l.  I started sobbing in front of the doc because no one can fix me and it's been over 30 days. She gave me a shot of lorazepam and sent me on my way.. on 4.23.2020 I meet with my pcp.  He runs a t4 free 1.4mg/l and reruns tsh which is now 6.63. I seriously think covid attacks everything.. thyroid, kidneys, liver, heart, brain, gut, skin.. what a huge list.  So people just look at you like you have 10 heads with all these symptoms.  Around this time I was prescribed 1mg of lorazepam and 50mg of trazodone to help sleep. From about 4.23.2020 to now, I have felt a steady improvement.  I had been able to do some yard work, ride my bike, and take walks.   I thought I was about 85% myself.. then around 5.3.2020 I started to feel like I was regressing.  Was it because I ate twizzlers and peanut m&amp;Ms that damn processed sugar? Did I over do it on the exercise? 4.5 miles on a bike isn't much for me on flat land... Also on 5.5.2020 I tested negative for antibodies igg and igm ab covid.  Is that playing tricks on my mind. The symptoms I currently have are weird.  My hands feel like they were dipped in icy hot, the diarrhea has returned, I got cold easy, less appetite, minor muscle aches, minor tightness in chest, foggy head , abdominal pain, mild palpitations, minor headaches and muscle sores.. this all is milder from what I had before.  I don't have a fever and my oxi level is between 96 and 99. I have a doctor's appointment on Tuesday.

I seriously think covid attacks everything.. thyroid, kidneys, liver, heart, brain, gut, skin.. what a huge list.  So people just look at you like you have 10 heads with all these symptoms.  Around this time I was prescribed 1mg of lorazepam and 50mg of trazodone to help sleep. From about 4.23.2020 to now, I have felt a steady improvement.  I had been able to do some yard work, ride my bike, and take walks.   I thought I was about 85% myself.. then around 5.3.2020 I started to feel like I was regressing.  Was it because I ate twizzlers and peanut m&amp;amp;Ms that damn processed sugar? Did I over do it on the exercise? 4.5 miles on a bike isn&amp;#39;t much for me on flat land... Also on 5.5.2020 I tested negative for antibodies igg and igm ab covid.  Is that playing tricks on my mind. The symptoms I currently have are weird.  My hands feel like they were dipped in icy hot, the diarrhea has returned, I got cold easy, less appetite, minor muscle aches, minor tightness in chest, foggy head , abdominal pain, mild palpitations, minor headaches and muscle sores.. this all is milder from what I had before.  I don&amp;#39;t have a fever and my oxi level is between 96 and 99. I have a doctor&amp;#39;s appointment on Tuesday. I truly hope this ends soon.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Hey everybody. We've had some negative test results and it's causing us some confusion and consternation. Here's our tale:

We went into self-quarantine on March 15th. My wife (40yo) had some chest pain on March 22nd, during which time our 2-year-old started having a cough that would end up lasting a week or so. He's been just fine since then. The 4-year-old was unaffected. Wife felt better for a couple of days after the pain, then had GI issues on the 24th and began having body aches and mild fevers on-and-off for the following 2 weeks. Then she was well again, and we started taking short hikes with the boys in Forest Park, being relatively careful to maintain social distancing with the other trail hikers. Then a week later, symptoms restarted... body aches and fevers, on-and-off. Very unusual, and nothing we've ever experienced before. Definitely in line with a lot of the anecdotes that we're reading here. Now we've had a solid 6 weeks of this, though fevers have decreased a bit. Body aches, decreased appetite, sleep, and the mental state that comes with little sleep are now significant challenges.

My wife had the nasal swab about a week and half ago, and it came back negative. We thought ok, maybe we're too far into the illness for it to still be active in the nasal cavity. Then she had the IgG blood-sample antibody test done a week ago. Also negative. Hmm.

Although I've felt relatively fine during this time, I (45yo male) elected to have my blood-based (ELISA IgG) antibody test performed as well, in case I was asymptomatic, and just received the results. Also negative. Fine, but what does that mean for my wife?

Given the timing of this thing, I'd be extremely surprised if these tests were accurate. Has anybody else had similar issues with these tests? I'm particularly wondering about the blood-based antibody tests, which are supposed to be quite accurate, at least as far as false negatives are concerned. 

We have had other blood work done, and have found slightly lowered sodium and low potassium. Nothing else stands out at this point.

Does anybody have any insight here?

Then neuro symptoms and weird weird dreams. I felt tingly throughout my body and something like electric shocks. 

Then i got whooshing headaches, and ear aches. It was almost like i could hear air or fluid throughout. It was painful as hell.

I started having kind of hallucinations.

Then my chest started burning, and dry cough again. 

Sores in mouth went away in a day

My oxygen has stayed 95-97 this entire time.

I would wake up gasping. I had to really focus on breathing at times. I had the oxygen meter on me at all times. I slept sitting up.

&lt;p&gt;I feel relatively normal now. Slight head ache at times, no gi symptoms, no gasping for air. Im still careful not to over do it. 
I do have pain towards my collarbone, and my chest occasionally feels like its burning but its so very slight can barely notice.  I am still bringing up the white stuff ocassionally. And some what of a headache but not often at all and less in severity. Sometimes tingly in my hands but not bad at all, and ocassionally stabby feeling in my foot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My oxygen is still 97 sometimes 98. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am i turning the corner??? I really hope im through the worse of it.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Hi everyone, I was never confirmed positive, but I presume I may have been positive back in early March with fever and a wicked dry cough. I got over that without much problems, but ever since around 15 March I've had this nagging minor chest tightness. It feels like minor congestion and it's been like this for like 56 days now!

A couple of weeks ago, I called my nurse advice line and they recommended I get tested. Before the test, they did a prescreen and checked my oxygen which was 100%. Test came back negative, yet chest tightness / congestion still remains. I also sometimes randomly get mild nausea and dizziness. 

I've started taking Mucinex 1200 mg and, surprisingly, that does seem to help with the congestion feeling, but I never actually cough anything up. It's so frustrating! I'd like to get a chest x-ray to see if there is anything abnormal, but I'm not even sure if anything would show up.

My brother first caught something in mid February that lasted around 2 weeks. He had an awful cough, it just wouldn’t go away, constant during the day and night. He also had a really bad headache, body aches and was very tired. He said to me it felt like he had pneumonia and went to the doctors because he felt like he had stuff on is lungs, but was just told to rest and he recovered in two weeks. My mum caught something at around the end of February (the situation at this point in the UK was not too bad, no Lockdown or closures) and experienced something similar. She also had an awful cough that lasted three weeks and felt a chest tightness and slight shortness of breath, also had extreme aches in her legs and was in bed for two days. Was also extremely fatigued, had a nasty headache and weirdly lost her voice completely for around a week and a half. I’m pretty sure if someone had these symptoms now they would be presumed positive and or would be tested. Is it likely they had COVID-19 in mid to late February? They are both ok now after around 2-2 and a half weeks. For me personally I did not get any symptoms and we all live in the same household? Could they have had the virus?&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"I keep seeing people posting about symptoms lasting for months, I just wanna get one more voice in here to say that’s by no means normal.  I had a mild case, and note that I never stopped working the whole time I was sick (I work from home for a tech company).  To be honest, if we were still in office and I didn’t know there was a highly infectious and deadly disease going around, I would have just thought this was a cold and kept coming in to work.  I’ve genuinely had colds worse than my case of COVID-19, so if you get this, just be aware, you’re probably gonna be totally fine.

I got sick with this disease starting March 31st, and symptoms lasted until April 17th.  By that day, I was considered well enough by the CDC to break social isolation (no fever, other symptoms subsided, and at least 7 days since original symptoms).  I had a residual cough until last week, but that is gone now too.  A week by week breakdown of my symptoms would look like...

Week 1 - The Eon of the Cough:  Cough.  Oh my god the cough.  Literally constant, ceaseless, dry cough.  I didn’t have a thermometer but I never felt feverish, so I don’t *think* I ever had a fever but can’t totally rule it out.  Fatigue didn’t hit for 5 days, but when it did it hit like a truck.  I slept 32 hours over that weekend.

Week 2 - The Era of Lethargy:  Still coughing, tapered off from day 8 to day 14.  This week was defined by being super sleepy.  I’m lucky my work slowed down, because it was hard to focus on excel sheets while I just wanted to lay down on my bed (which I did frequently.  Once my roommate tested positive I let my boss know and was given the all clear to dip out whenever I needed to, or take some time off if necessary).  So yeah, tons of sleep.  10-11 hours most nights, with generous naps during the day.  This lasted through to the end of the week.

Week 3 - The Age of Recovery:  Felt mostly myself by the beginning of week 3.  Managed to get my hands on a thermometer by day 18 where I consistently read a body temp of 95.5-.8 degrees, so I guess I run cold.  Clearly no fever.  Cough had disappeared enough at this point that I’d consider it residual, and my sleep schedule was normal by day 18 as well.  For these reasons, I consider day 18 my last “sick” day.

Week 4 and Beyond - The Epoch of Normalcy:  Residual cough slowly declined over the next 2 weeks.  I still cough occasionally, a few times a day, but I wouldn’t say I have, “a cough”.  Fatigue is totally gone and I’ve begun light exercise (don’t wanna relapse), but those two symptoms were the bulk of my sickness and they’re gone now.  Now it’s just back to quarantine boredom and making plans to actually get back to consistently exercising again.  Thinking about maybe learning a language too.  No better time right?

So yeah, I now feel 100% back to my normal self.  As I said above, none of these symptoms were *horrible*.  I’ve had regular colds that felt worse, and if the world wasn’t like it is right now, would’ve felt fine going to work like I was.

Just wanted to get this out there.  I see a lot of health anxiety out there about this virus, and keep a few things in mind.  Stress and anxiety is terrible for your mental health, and it can even be terrible for your physical health.  I don’t want to downplay anything, the mother of my friend was on ventilator for 2 weeks and is only just beginning to recover, but keep in mind this could also just be a mild annoyance.  Be careful, wear a mask, disinfect, but if you get it, stay calm.  It’s better for your mental *and* physical health.

&lt;p&gt;Week 4 and Beyond - The Epoch of Normalcy:  Residual cough slowly declined over the next 2 weeks.  I still cough occasionally, a few times a day, but I wouldn’t say I have, “a cough”.  Fatigue is totally gone and I’ve begun light exercise (don’t wanna relapse), but those two symptoms were the bulk of my sickness and they’re gone now.  Now it’s just back to quarantine boredom and making plans to actually get back to consistently exercising again.  Thinking about maybe learning a language too.  No better time right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I now feel 100% back to my normal self.  As I said above, none of these symptoms were &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt;.  I’ve had regular colds that felt worse, and if the world wasn’t like it is right now, would’ve felt fine going to work like I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to get this out there.  I see a lot of health anxiety out there about this virus, and keep a few things in mind.  Stress and anxiety is terrible for your mental health, and it can even be terrible for your physical health.  I don’t want to downplay anything, the mother of my friend was on ventilator for 2 weeks and is only just beginning to recover, but keep in mind this could also just be a mild annoyance.  Be careful, wear a mask, disinfect, but if you get it, stay calm.  It’s better for your mental &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; physical health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alert, not anxious.  Stay healthy, and if you’ve got it, I wish you the best of luck in your recovery ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Okay so back in late January my parents came to visit  us in Northern California from out of state. Right after they left my dad came down with symptoms that are pretty consistent with Covid 19(but had no idea at the time). General misery and developed shortness of breath after a week where he could barely get up to go to the bathroom without having to catch his breath. Then my mother got it also, sever fatigue, cough, muscle aches, fever, chills, and total loss of sense of smell and taste which she has still not fully recovered from. My mother told me she was so out of it at times she didn't even care if she lived or died. My dad is much better but still struggles a bit with being out of breath more than before. Anyway, my mom became convinced she had it and took an antibody test that came back negative(Abbot labs test).

I still decided to get tested just to see, although after her negative test I wasn't expecting much. I tested positive for antibodies. What happened is about 12 days after my parents left my 6 year old son developed a slight cough. This was in early-mid February, (I spent my Valentines day sick). I thought he was just getting a little cold, not a big deal but my wife wanted me to take his temperature and it was 101.5. So I kept him out of school a few days, but by the next day his fever was reduced and on the third day it was normal so he went back to school. About a day later I started developing a cough and a slight runny nose. My runny nose was gone the next day but my cough was getting worse.

&amp;#x200B;

On the third day I came back to the house after dropping my son off at school and started feeling cold and kept turning the thermostat up.  Then I suddenly got serious chills and started visibly shaking. So I realized, okay I have a bit more than a slight cold. I stayed home and rested and the chills went away by the evening. However, the next couple days I felt really run down with a cough and body aches. But by the end of the third day I started to feel relatively better except for the cough. The following week I felt okay except I was very tired, like I cannot work more than 2-3 hours at my computer before I felt the overwhelming need to lie down and rest. After that I felt mostly better but my cough lasted about 7  weeks(yes, you heard that right, weeks), I just couldn't shake it. Even now when I am tired in the evening I sometimes get a bit of a dry cough, it really did a number on my lungs I guess. Anyway I am mostly better now except for allergies.

Around day 5 of my illness my wife got sick, at first with  a slight sore throat, then the next day she woke up with a horrible headache. That progressed to body aches, fevers and cough for the rest of the week. After the first week she started to feel better but felt  extremely fatigued for weeks, but her cough went away faster. She also lost her  sense of taste and smell. I thought we probably just all had the flu in spite of getting our flu shots.

It is weird my parents had similar but worse symptoms and my mom tested negative, and I positive. Perhaps we got different bugs, or perhaps that was just the flu and I got an asymptomatic case later. My son did get a bad cough again a couple weeks after he recovered from the first one, and I was worried he wasn't getting better and the doctor told me it was probably just a re-infection of something else. This was the week before school closed  and everything locked down. So maybe that was it and I got an asymptomatic  case from him on his second infection?

My youngest daughter is under 2 and has been having on/off fevers  for about a month and developed what looked like a viral rash about 2 weeks ago. The rash transformed into these horrible looking scabs on her back which are now healed. Well, once again, she developed a fever on Sunday night and had it till Tuesday. No other symptoms.

We got her tested on Monday and the results came back negative last night. I'm very confused by this as I swear we have covid in our house due to my symptoms.

My symptoms started on Sunday night on April 26th. I felt like I got hit by a truck, developed a horrible sore throat which developed into a cough over the next few days.

I'm 100% positive I have the virus but wasn't allowed to get tested until now. I'm still having weird stuff going on with me. My back aches so bad, my heart races, and I can barely run 2 miles (I'm a very fit marathon runner). So, now I have a test scheduled for tomorrow.

,COVID19positive,"Hi all,

I tested positive 3/22. My symptoms were mild lasting a week. Phlegm in throat, lowgrade fever, some minor chest pain. I was out of work for a month and had no symptoms for almost a month. I go back to work 4/23 since I am considered medically recovered based on CDC guidelines. I did not have another test. I notice some people at work are coughing but I'm hoping that since I had COVID already I have antibodies that make me immune. I feel completely fine and healthy.

One week later, I wake up with fatigue, high fever, GI issues, heart palpitations and chest pain. I take the day off from work and hope i'll recover over the weekend. Over the weekend, I get an email saying one of my close proximity coworkers who was coughing when I came back to work tested positive with COVID-19. This time my symptoms are worse. The heart palpitations are what really bothers me. My heart is beating so hard, I can feel my lips twitching. Any activity even getting up from bed aggravates my heart rate. Any food I eat, I can feel my blood pressure dropping, heart rate flaring and have sudden exhaustion.

Now I have no idea if this a reinfection or relapse. But my symptoms are suddenly a lot more severe than the first time I got sick. It feels like a completely different infection.

I am wondering if instead of becoming immune, the initial infection made me vulnerable to reinfection.

This article shows patients recovering but getting reinfected and dying from heart issues which I am afraid is what I am experiencing. If anyone has any similar experiences please let me know.

I would like to find out why after a month of being completely fine, as soon as I go back to work AND exposed to a confirmed positive, I become symptomatic again.

Update (5/7/20 1:35 PM) :

I visited my PCP today. I had an ECG. Normal. Lungs listened to with a stethoscope. Normal. Temperature is 98.8. Fever is down from the initial miserable fever of 100+ I felt during the weekend, but 98.8 is still higher than what I normally am around which is 97.6. I still have chest pain. Elevated heart rate was noted. The doctor suggested that we COULD do another COVID-19 test but the result wouldn't change my treatment plan as far as she could provide and there was no treatment for COVID. The doctor did not refer me to a lung or heart CT due to my vitals appearing normal. I was referred to a cardiologist for my palpitations. Bloodtest was conducted to check for infection. I am waiting on those results.

My main take away from this experience is that we have no idea the long term implications of this virus. We don't know how long we can remain contagious for and whether or not we might relapse or possibly be reinfected after seemingly fully recovering for 1 month like I did.

I thought I was going to die, but two weeks went by and I got better. Now, a month an a half later I have residual virus in my system (lungs and intestines) that has caused a flare up of sorts.

I tested negative for covid almost three weeks ago now after having a throbbing headache that lasted for about 2 weeks, on top of some nausea and chest pain, alternating between a severe heartburn like feeling to a stabbing pain. After my negative test result however, I started developing a sore throat and a sort of rattling feeling in my chest, felt somewhat like there was something crackling in my lungs. I also developed an elevated temp for about two weeks, the highest was 99.8, usually it ranged from 99.1-99.5 most days. Nothing in the high fever range, but my usual baseline temp is around 97.5. I also had a headache during the higher fever days, which got worse when I coughed, which would happen sporadically. On Sunday, I woke up out of a deep sleep in the early am and my heart was racing, I checked it with my hr monitor and it was 135, but I could feel my heart like it was trying to jump out of my chest. I wondered if it may have been anxiety (unlikely since I was asleep 2 seconds before) so I tried to do some deep breathing exercises to try to calm it down, after about 10-12 minutes with no change I called the ER and they told me to come in. They diagnosed me with early stage pneumonia and put me in antibiotics for 5 days (a Z pac).

,COVID19positive,"Hi all,

I’m a student at a US university studying psychology, specifically how psychological factors affect individuals’ health behaviors. If you have time to participate, the survey linked below asks about your attitudes and behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a pretty comprehensive survey, taking about 20-40 minutes (time is a wide range because many questions are open-ended). As an undergrad, I wish I could compensate everyone for participation, but I'm only able to to a gift card raffle. If you complete the survey and choose to be entered, we will randomly select participants to win gift cards. **You will submit any identifiable info (email address for a gift card) through a separate link that is not tied to your responses. We're hoping to recruit a geographically diverse and representative sample, so any help is greatly appreciated!**

Our IRB (a regulatory board that protects research participants) has required that I add the following:

A psychology research lab at Loyola University is conducting a study on adults’ **(over the age of 36)** response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If you’re interested in participating, please click the link. Please do not comment on your participation in the study or lack thereof.

,COVID19positive,"Hi all,

I wish I were here with some good news of a fully healed person, but unfortunately that's not yet for me today! Still dealing with low grade fever, headaches and dizziness mostly.

I just had another full blood test, and my GP thought it good to do the serology test while we were at it, since we are pretty sure it was the Covid-19 despite the nose swab test being negative (taken at day 41 of my symptoms). I just got the results back, and, surprise, both IgG and IgM are negatives! I kind of freaked out when seeing this. My first reaction was to wonder if this was all in my head? Like could I have imagined 50 days of fever, fatigue, oppression in my chest among other pleasantries? Could it just be my anxiety? 

I am 'lucky' in a sense that my blood test shows that my red blood cells are fairly high (nothing crazy, but definitely higher than they should be), and white blood cells are a bit low, which is a good sign of an infection and a proof that I wasn't imagining it or lying. Now, could it be something else than Covid? All the other elements they tested are fine, apart from the blood cells it looks as if I'm healthy as a horse (lucky me), so the usual suspects of mononucleosis and friends are out. 

Could it also be that I have not developed specific antibodies? I have been ill for so long, could it be because my body has not been able to produce antibodies to defend specifically against this fairly weird virus? Will it mean that I can get reinfected soon?

The lady at the lab who drew my blood told me that they are only testing for two out of the three virus heads, and even if this came back negative, it might be worth testing again in a few months just to check if I am positive with another test. I also read that these tests are producing a lot of false negatives, could this be one? It is not yet fully approved by the health authorities here, and I had to pay it out of my own pocket despite GP's prescription.

I was curious, have any of you been in a similar situation, or heard anything from the scientific community about these tests and all that?

,COVID19positive,"I'm trying to determine if it's worth my time to schedule an anti-body test.

 

About a week and a half ago I had what I assume was tonsillitis (never had before) following a week of crazy post-nasal drip.  I know it's allergy season and all, but I've NEVER been a person who dealt with seasonal allergies.

&amp;#x200B;

My tonsil issue abated, and then starting Sunday (this last sunday) I started having weird chest pains.  Like muscle pains, but my muscles weren't sore.  Then my lungs felt really hot? Weird as hell.  I had a few coughs a day, and that has subsided.  All this time I've just assumed I was experiencing some weird cold.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then after the burning sensations ceased, I was left feeling asthmatic.  Now I had childhood asthma, I know what that feels like.  I'm describing this as asthmatic, but asthma felt like my throat was closing, this felt lower in my chest.  This weird thing has hung around a bit, flaring up randomly during the day and before I go to bed.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have no ran a fever whatsoever.

January 18th (backstory): I was diagnosed with mono (I got lucky with a mild case in my opinion)

March 5-7: developed minor cough, didn't think much of it. Also sore throat (started losing voice), nausea, chills, congestion in nose.

March 8: hurt throat to sneeze, cough, breathe, some chest pressure (but I wondered if it was anxiety)

March 8-15: mostly just minor cough

March 15-19: minor fever 98.9, nausea, fatigue, cough/sore throat continued, felt like I was out of breath from talking, but not necessarily difficulty breathing (still wondered if it was anxiety), swollen lymph nodes

March 21-23: cough started getting raspier and noticed it more in the back of my throat, minor burning, chest pressure, migraine, swollen lymph nodes, ear pressure, spleen pain, throat not sore. Called my doctor and she diagnosed me with bronchitis as a secondary infection to mono via telehealth. She gave me azythromycin and an inhaler. 

March 24-26: didn't feel like I was improving much and actually felt like I was getting worse. Chest burning started getting worse (feels almost like Vicks or Icy hot in my chest), fatigue, still able to go for walks but felt like walking irritated my lungs, swollen lymph nodes, coughing became painful in chest so tried not to cough, continued migraines, chest hurt to laugh

March 27-28: chest pain, continued cough, but felt slightly better, went for a run

March 29: chest and burning slightly worse...too ambitious with exercise yesterday?

March 30: chest burning and fatigue, hurts to cough again, doctor said burning in chest likely due to acid reflux from antibiotics or infection. Tums did not seem to help chest burning much.

April 1-4: continued migraines, burning in chest (but getting used to it) people burning things outside irritated my lungs enough that I took my inhaler

April 5-15: started improving. Was able to go for walks and runs

April 16: sore throat, swollen lymph nodes 

April 17-19: minor complaints

April 20: swollen nodes, sore throat, cough, breathing difficulty

April 20-26: feeling better

April 26-29: cough getting worse again, slight burning, tired, nauseous, chills, migraine

May 1-3: sore throat, ear congestion 

May 4-6: throat extremely sore, laceration in throat, white specks on tonsils, extreme fatigue, chills, minor fever 98.8-99.0, on and off chest burning. Doctor says I have a virus via telehealth

Throughout all of this, I have had on and off spleen pain (still due to mono?!), headaches (some minor, some migraines),  chest burning, chest pressure (to the point I have to lay on my stomach most evenings), minor cough, chills (mild fever 98.8 - 99.0, especially at night), fatigue. I would like to point out that even though I've been experiencing a lot of different symptoms, my symptoms seem pretty minor if it is COVID-19.

Having covid was a fucking nightmare, I was essentially given a 3 day death sentence in the first week. I ended up recovering, but it scared me so bad I haven’t left the house since I got sick. I’ve been doing everything right for 2 months, and now I’m getting sick again?

- March 9: Symptoms started
- March 10: Within 24 hours of developing a cough I was receiving emergency resp. care
- March 14: Told I wouldn’t survive 3 more days
- March 19: Big turnaround, energy returning
- March 31: All symptoms seem to have cleared

The one symptom that stuck around (and is still ongoing) are the dark red circles around my eyes, runny eyes, blurry vision.

**Jump to the evening of May 4:**
- My symptoms began in the evening, exactly as they did the first time around. A persistent, dry cough that began sounding pneumatic within mere hours. Headache, chills, body aches.
- edit to add: shallow feeling in lungs, ribs feel bruised
- I’m currently still breathing alright, with minor shallowness in my chest.
- I have steroids and an inhaler this time around, and I’ve scheduled a teledoc appointment.

- March 31: All symptoms seem to have cleared&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one symptom that stuck around (and is still ongoing) are the dark red circles around my eyes, runny eyes, blurry vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jump to the evening of May 4:&lt;/strong&gt;
- My symptoms began in the evening, exactly as they did the first time around. A persistent, dry cough that began sounding pneumatic within mere hours. Headache, chills, body aches.
- edit to add: shallow feeling in lungs, ribs feel bruised
- I’m currently still breathing alright, with minor shallowness in my chest.
- I have steroids and an inhaler this time around, and I’ve scheduled a teledoc appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the fuck is going on though? Why is this happening? Am I genuinely sick again or is this an immune response?&lt;/p&gt;

Day 1 - Woke up with a stuffy, clogged nose and a massive headache.

Day 2 - Sinuses still clogged, slight chest pain, harder to breath when using my stairs. Decided to go to the doctor. Fever of 101, was tested. Slight body ache.

Day 3 - Productive cough, coughing up mucus, having to constantly clear my throat. Body aches getting worse, pressure in chest, fever wavering between 100-101. Sinus status: Screwed

Day 4 - Same as Day 3, more tired, VERY tired by this point.

Day 5 - Coughing is harder because it makes me run out of breath, feel like there's a brick in my chest, but still not the worst I've ever had. Would think bad cold if I didn't know. Sinuses still clogged, fever broke. Body is aching so much putting a blanket on hurts.

Day 6 - Test results came back positive. Fever still broken, have to nap several times a day at this point. Sinuses starting to clear, cough becoming ""more productive"" (easier to cough up the crap in my throat). Headache but not pounding like before.

Day 7 - SO. TIRED. Can't walk to the bathroom without needing to nap. Zero appetite (haven't been hungry since around day 4), sinuses are mostly clear. Still clearing my throat every 5 minutes, brick in chest is gone, breathing seems a bit easier. No fever.

Day 8 (today) - Woke up at 3PM and still tired. Can't get up to go to the bathroom without resting at least twice because I'm just that tired. Breathing is okay, only stairs really make me run out of breath at this point. No chest pressure. Coughing is the most productive it's been, easier to get things up and spit it out. Sinuses still a little stuffed up, but not too bad. Fever still gone. Very achy still.

Things I've done: Tons of water and hot broth. Hot bath helps the body aches (only after my fever was gone, before that it was a room temperature bath). Tylenol every few hours. OTC decongestant for my sinuses (didn't do anything first few days, helped a lot when it got a little better).

And I'm not necessarily scared for me although I have no insurance and my SSi number has been stolen, making it harder for me to get said insurance, but for my gf who has mild asthma and likes to smoke blunts (cuz of my dumbass).

Also, stupid question,  if we are infected, would we be able to quarantine w eachother or would it make it worse?

,COVID19positive,"I know this can come in ebbs and flows and am prepared for this to come back but as of this week I feel really great. My mom and I both feel as though our symptoms were minor. My dad definitely got it worse than us but has been stable. Figured I’d share our experience so far! 

Apologies for the length, wanted to be thorough. 

Me - 26F, No medical history.
Days prior to 4/17 I had some chills and a sore throat. I also had some pretty bad heartburn which I’ve never had before this. Throughout the whole thing I’ve had no real fever, O2 97-99%. 

4/17  Sore throat got worse, very dry and felt like it was cracked open, had a mild cough. 

4/18 Had a low grade fever (99.5) with chest congestion. 

4/19 Fever gone, chest congestion was better. 

4/20 Chest congestion and cough came back. Fatigued. 

4/21 Chest congestion slightly worse.  I lost my sense of smell &amp; taste. Head and sinuses throbbing. Burning sensation in one nostril that persisted for a few days. 

4/22 Smell/taste still gone, chest felt heavy/achy/congested. Got tested this day, was (+)

4/23-4/27 Headaches got more severe and I had a slight increase in shortness of breath, very fatigued these days as well. Appetite decreased &amp; very nauseated. 

4/28 headache/sinus ache to end all headaches, I was incapacitated all day. 

4/29 -5/1 breathing easier, aches subsided only mild headaches. One episode of GI upset. 

5/2-5/3 Energy is back, the weird ache in my chest as almost gone. Appetite is back. Still get little episodes of shortness of breath. I was able to do a short yoga class without any issues. Heartburn is back. 

5/4-5/5 - feel 100% better. Just want out of this house! Awaiting results of retest. 

Mom - 59F, history of a narrow trachea which causes a chronic cough. Takes a steroid inhaler. Her O2 has been 96-98%, no fever besides her first day of symptoms. 

4/22 Low grade fever, 100.4 and chills. Coughing more. 

4/23 started to feel missternal chest congestion, little short of breath. 

4/24-4/30 Tested 4/24, came back (+). Up and downs every day with the chest congestion and shortness of breath, but never winded. Cough slightly worse.  She had the same chest aches/heaviness I had. Biggest complaints were nerve pain in her legs and hands, persistent dizziness, as well as some diarrhea and appetite loss. Honestly seems like she was had more neuro symptoms than anything. 

5/1-5/3 energy is back, chest heaviness/aches are gone. Her appetite is improving but the diarrhea has stayed. Has jolts of nerve pain but mostly has gone away. 

5/4-5/5 little short of breath here and there but otherwise no symptoms. 

Dad - 64M
History of high BP, heart failure, COPD, 35 year smoker - quit 12 years ago. The doctor told us his baseline O2 is between 94-96% and he’s been between 94-98% throughout this. 

4/21-4/25 dry cough and pretty intense muscle aches. Overall feeling pretty well though. Tested 4/25, came back negative but the doctors believe we tested him too early and he’s presumptive positive. 

4/26-4/27 overnight between these two days he developed a 102 degree fever, rigors, severe headache. His HR was 100-110 with the fever (came down once it was gone). Says it’s the worst he’s ever felt in his life. We weren’t able to get the fever down until midmorning on the 27th. Very, very fatigued. Fever did come back but not as high. 100.8 was the highest we got. Had a lot of diarrhea 4/27. 

4/28-5/1 fatigue was persisting but he was able to get up and do stuff around the house. His cough had gotten worse, but he denied any shortness of breath or chest pain. He just had that same weird chest heaviness that me and my mom had.  No fever at all (usually around 98.6). We had him go to the doctors cuz of the persistent cough and his chest x-ray came back clear. Very achy throughout body. 

5/2-5/3 Still coughing but it is lessening. Chest congestion has cleared. Still fatigued but not as much. Muscle aches and nerve pain is gone. Says he’s feeling a lot better. Retested, waiting for results. 

5/4 spiked a fever again, 100.4. O2 dipped slightly. Cough is nasty this day. Fatigued. 

5/5 - no fever, cough slightly improved. Very fatigued. 

Besides my dads temps and one day of low O2, we have all had stable vitals. I can honestly say that my mom and I are feeling close to 100%. Dad is on the mend but he is a few days behind us. 

Not funny but kind of funny, my brother and sister in law (she is an LPN at a nursing home that has a lot of COVID cases) actually caught COVID as well a few days before us, and we haven’t seen each other since February.

( way over my head) 

However, I decided to look up iscahmia in fingers and toes.

Some of the pictures I found look very similar to the discoloration found in Covid19 hands ( including my own).

 I decided to look up digital ischemia  &amp; Covid and found this page

&amp;#x200B;

It states :  

Digit ischemia associated with development of antiphospholipid antibodies which can arise transiently in patients with critical illness/viral infections. The presence of these antibodies may rarely lead to thrombotic events that are difficult to differentiate from other causes of multifocal thrombosis in critically patients, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, heparininduced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathy.(Zhang, NEJM, 2020 April 11)  

&amp;#x200B;

So it this what Covid Number red fingers are caused by? The development of antibodies?

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone here had numb/frostbite feel/pins and needles hands resolve?

Do something? Please any advice would help. My family was all there, so any advice would help. Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandmother for the moment seems to have a mild case, she doesn’t have problems with her lungs. She experienced shortness of breath one night. The biggest case for her is that she lost any appetite for a week. She also hid from us she had a fever. My grandfather seems to be asymptomatic. His results are coming tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"23/AFAB, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (autoimmune disease) and asthma

Hey, everyone! I feel almost like I'm going crazy over here, so I wanted to see if maybe anyone else is in the same boat or has any advice.

I work at a campus food pantry, but I have been self-quarantining for the most part since early March. Given my pre-existing health conditions, my doctor told me in no uncertain terms not to be a hero and to stay at home. I have stopped by the pantry a couple times for admin tasks, gone to the grocery, etc., but I have stayed in isolation for the vast majority of the past 8 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

April 27/28: General malaise, a little pressure in my chest, runny nose. I chalked it up to allergies.

April 29: Pressure in my chest increased, felt like I couldn't fully inflate my lungs, mild sore throat, headache, itchy everywhere, nauseated but no vomiting

April 30/May 1: Intensity of everything increased, low-grade fever (99.2), bounced back and forth between way too hot and way too cold, everything tasted metallic, body aches and skin sensitivity were uncomfortable

May 2: Everything was a little more intense than the day before, pressure in my lungs got worse, shortness of breath made it hard to continue a regular conversation, **went to the ER and tested negative for COVID-19 with no signs of pneumonia on my chest x-ray**

May 3/4: My lungs felt a little better and no fever, but everything else remained the same

May 5/6: Body aches and skin sensitivity through the roof, headache worse, still can't sing along to my radio due to shortness of breath :(

&amp;#x200B;

The ER told me that I definitely have some sort of viral infection and just to check in with my doctor. They didn't take blood or swab for anything else, only the COVID-19 test. My lungs looked fine on the chest x-ray, but they told me that I would've been admitted if my sats had been lower due to my symptoms.

I honestly have not felt this bad since December 2016 when I had a post-surgical infection and spent 2 days in bed with a 103F fever. I have no idea how to handle this. I'm officially on emergency leave from work, and I feel insanely lucky to have the option to do so without jeopardizing my livelihood. I feel so guilty for taking the time when I know that my work needs me, and like such a baby for being bothered by not being able to do silly things like sing along to the radio.

Anyone in the same boat? Have any advice? Pictures of cute dogs? I'll take anything at this point.

,COVID19positive,"29M, no comorbidities save for a 2mm classic MVP, which never interfered with me riding a bike 5 days a week for the past 3 years though. For the last half a year I\`ve experienced Covid19-like symptoms three times already, with more or less even intervals.

Onset dates: Dec 16, Feb 10, Apr 25.

Symptoms:

1. Cough (Dec — severe, Feb/Apr — couple coughs daily)
2. Watery stool 1–3 times daily for 3 days after onset
3. Tachycardia of 100–140bpm, especially after getting out of bed or after shower — although this one can be attributed to anxiety I\`ve been through since January; there was a single episode of my bpm reaching 170, called an ambulance that eventually got me tested for corona, waiting for a result
4. Low intermittent fever, never crossed 38°C / 100.4°F; more on the fever below
5. Noises in my bronchi that can only be heard with a stethoscope, leading doctors to diagnose me with bronchitis (that resolves in about a week); nothing whatsoever heard or X-rayed in the lungs
6. Absolutely no objective shortness of breath: my SpO₂ level is always 96–99% according to the oximeter; seems not to be a glitch, for I tried to hold my breath for as long as I could and the level dropped to mid-80s.

Now for the fever. I\`ve got both an IR thermometer and a mercury one, the latter always showing me temperatures below 37.5°C / 99.5°F. The former, however, is able to produce three separate results for my forehead and both armpits, so I average them. Don\`t know if this has any accuracy to it, for the readings may differ by more than 1°C.  
When I get out of bed at least one spot can be above 38°C but a couple minutes later they all drop to between the high 36s and low 37s.

Does this look like CV?  
Many symptoms suggest it does, but I still cannot shake off the bronchial weirdness and the lack of SOB.

,COVID19positive,"Hello!

First of all, this sub has been a great comforter, I was able to cross check several times with the experiences of others and this kept myself sane, level-headed and calm.

Here is my case, please feel free to share this information if it helps, and feel free to ask for more.

**Background:**

I started self-quarantine on March 06 as my sister arrived from Milan to visit me for my bday. She traveled from Milan to Bergamo by bus and from there took a flight here. There was people coughing on the plane (including an air steward).

She took the best precautions she could while traveling, wore a mask the whole trip, in the end we believe the mistake was either bad use of the mask or that I hugged her as we met on her arrival to the airport. Its possible I got infected first and then I infected her, given the timeline, but we still have several theories.

on March 09 Italy closed, and on March 12 the emergency situation started here. We had been in quarantine since before anyway. First symptom for me started on March 13. My sister had no symptoms until a day she felt breathless (March 18, day 14 of her travel, she described it as a panic attack or anxiety). She had it for a couple of days and then felt better and showed no more symptoms since.

I called my doctor on March 19, explained everything and our symptoms. She said it was a clear suspect case given the circumstances. We were to keep full quarantine 14 days, and call an ambulance if the breathing got worse. No test as we were not in any risk group and at that time only those at risk or at the ER were being tested. Things have changed now and I'm waiting for the antibody testing as they will test everyone here for antibodies at one point.

My case was wavy like many people here. I took no medicine whatsoever, only supplemented Vitamin D (100ug every other day) and took a daily multivitamin. My last respiratory symptom was on April 22. I felt 100% recovered between waves and went out walking 2 hours (same mistake like many here) which prompted the second wave.

Worst days were day 6, 7, 10, 31, and 32. In that order also from worse to meh.

[I logged everything I could.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dhTq4X0Rbq1t3xbBimlWhhM_f-LpS53C01yxtU6f5n0/edit?usp=sharing) That is a Google Sheets with every single measurement I could trying to be as detailed as possible. Its not the best design but it gave me a lot of visibility of my health status and development, I recommend everybody with symptoms to do this if they are not already.

**Some legends to the data:**

* ""BOT"" was my first way to check my oxygen/breathing, I vaguely remember it meaning something breathless baseline or similar from a YouTube video which I cant find anymore. Its just breathing normal and then suspend breathing after a normal exhalation, counting time until you feel the urge to breathe again. It was helpful until I got a pulse oximeter.
* ""Hold"" is the amount of time I was able to hold my breath after a big inhalation.
* Rating is the subjective feeling of the day, its a scale of 0 to 5 (from ""called ambulance"" to ""had a great day"")
* You'll find ""bb"" somewhere in the symptoms, its short for ""blue balls"", I had it a couple of times (once each wave) and it sucked.

**Some extra observations:**

* Temperature was measured under tongue at least 3 times a day during the active wave, I never felt feverish. Rest of measurements are done once at evening.
* Every single time I over did it on the sugar I felt worse.
* Caffeine made me feel pretty bad on the first wave, but was helpful on the second wave.
* Hot showers and inhaling vapor helped a lot, was relaxing and made breathing easier. I used to do this back when asthma, along with coffee to help breathing. Vapor was also recommended by the doctor.
* On nights of day 7 and 8 I felt like I was going to pass out when I was drifting to sleep, this was the point where I prepared my stuff and backpack in case I needed to go to ER.
* Sometimes I felt a very marked SoB with 98% PaO2, and other times I was doing my routine check to find myself at 95% PaO2 without feeling any SoB.
* I noticed my toenails going blueish at points where I felt weird, and getting back to pink after doing some deep inhalations.
* Airway clearing exercise that was posted here made me feel very good a couple of times and helped when I felt SoB. It was also during this exercise that I noticed the pulse oximeter show 99%

**Extra data about me:**

* Overweight and Childhood Asthma (last attack I was 7yrs old).
* Rarely get sick, but, I caught a flu on December, completely different as it lasted 2 days only and had a week of thick nasty yellow phlegm. After that ended, around mid February I started getting urticaria in my arms/legs after meals and was in the process of getting that checked when the pandemic started. The urticaria is accompanied with GI issues every time, reflux which is very uncommon for me. During the first wave and recovery it disappeared completely. I've had it again a couple of times, it sucks.
* I had been doing Intermittent Fasting 16:4 and hitting the Gym pretty good before all of this started. During first wave I kept IF until the point that I felt a lot of hunger and decided to follow my cravings to help my body, kept off food that causes inflammation as much as I could but cookies cheered me up. I'm easing back into IF again.
* I only measured my weight at beginning, middle and end: started at \[March 1: 86.40kg, 29%BF, 57.4%MM\], then \[April 19: 79.1kg, 28.9%BF, 52.5%MM\] and just before posting this \[78.90kg, 28.9%BF, 52.3%MM\]. Seems like I've lost both fat and muscle, (a lot), probably fighting this thing off mixed with healthier eating and cutting off alcohol. Haven't moved much since and I feel it, looking forward to the gym/pool.

I first started thinking about self-reporting in early April. For weeks I had been reading testimonials of the same situation over and over: people certain that they had come down with Covid-19, but couldn’t get tested because their symptoms weren’t severe enough, a testing center was hours away, or any number of reasons.

For weeks I had been reading testimonials of the same situation over and over: people certain that they had come down with Covid-19, but couldn’t get tested because their symptoms weren’t severe enough, a testing center was hours away, or any number of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

I have had B12 deficiency, though, and some comments about problems after recovery sound just like vitamin B12 deficiency.  It makes me wonder if fighting this virus might use up a lot of stored B12, and cause a deficiency afterward.

If you have one or more of these low-B12 symptoms after recovering:

* Widespread neurological issues
* Brain fog
* Memory problems
* Slow thinking
* Difficulty with word recall
* Tingling in feet, hands, or face
* Inexplicable tiredness
* Waves of fatigue
* Exercise intolerance
* Sudden sleepiness attacks
* Less-than-perfect balance (trips or falls)
* Mild depression or general blues, loss of color in life
* GI problems or IBS
* Tinnitus
* or any of these: [https://b12awareness.org/cobalamin-deficiency-criteria-list-risk-score-neurologic-psychiatric-gastrointestinal-hematologic/](https://b12awareness.org/cobalamin-deficiency-criteria-list-risk-score-neurologic-psychiatric-gastrointestinal-hematologic/)

...then consider taking a serum B12 test.  A healthy level is above 500 ng/mL (B12 should be middle to high in range) .  If it's lower than that, try a B12 shot to raise your levels quickly and see if that helps.  If B12 isn't needed, your body will excrete the excess in your urine.  If B12  is needed, you will start to feel better almost immediately. B12 injections are often marketed in clinics as ""energy shots"" or ""energy boosters"" for about $30; they don't sting.

Good luck and I hope you all feel better soon.

\*edit: if you have any of these recovery symptoms, and can comment if your B12 level was below or above 500 ng/mL, then maybe we can see if low B12 is causing these problems or not.  Thanks.

Guys, I may have this virus and it sucks...

About  a month ago I started feeling fluey which subsided quite quickly. Then I  got a headache, tightness on chest, loss of appetite, soreish throat  and these went quite quickly. I then had a couple of episodes of extreme  dizziness and vertigo.

I was laying down and had the snap, crackle and pops and mild wheezing.

I coughed sputum up that was discoloured and there were streaks of blood in them.

I had a mild cough too, but that kind of went.

I also had upper back pains and what felt like movement on lungs, especially back.

The colour changed from green to light but still remnants of blood.

I  also had abdomenal pains and chest pains. I also had metallic taste in  mouth and what felt like severe heartburn and a dusty feeling on lungs.  Up until recently the tightness returned and the crackles are still  there. Is it pointless X-RAYING? What's the chances of it being  something else when this thing is widespread?

I talked to the doctors and they think it's post-covid and condescend, although they suggested an X-RAY after my antibiotics.

I'll give a brief overview of symptoms - basically I want to know when to be really worried (especially with lung stuff and possible neurological symptoms).

5/2 - start of symptoms: extreme cramping/bloating in stomach, diarrhea, intense nausea, low grade fever, aches

5/3 - same as yesterday, fever hovers around 99.4

5/4 - still mostly GI stuff, fevers getting a bit higher same symptoms

5/5 - TEST DAY (in my area you can get tests regardless of symptoms): same symptoms as before, temp around 101, tingly and numb hands, chest burning, throat tightness (i can only describe this as it feels like i'm being choked), one coughing fit at night tried lying in 'prone position' felt my lungs or something popping and crackling REALLY WEIRD FEELING

5/6 - same symptoms except for the addition of an intense pain on the left side of my upper back, below shoulder blades spanning along ribs vertically , after deep breath almost a burning sensation but only on left side and in back? Doesn't feel like muscle pain or soreness because I don't get any relief from pressing/massaging it.

Basically, do you think it is likely that I have it? Or am I working myself up and should I just wait for the test. Should I be concerned about this back pain, is it indicative of stuff with my lungs? Also - I cannot get a pulse oximiter but I want to be prepared, what are the signs to go to the hospital or get chest X-Rays?

Thank you for any advice you can offer. My anxiety is going overboard and I feel overwhelmed on top of feeling really really not great.

\*\*Edit/Update\*\* 

5/7 - lung symptoms significantly worse. Intense back pain nearly constant, worse in certain positions, worse with deep breaths, tightness/aching/stabbing pains. A few coughing fits where it felt there was a frog in my throat that could not be cleared, these went on for \~20 minutes, calmed by drinking lots of warm tea, prone position, shallow breaths.

spoke to two doctors via telemed appointments. First doctor was very concerned about back and chest pains, felt I needed a physical exam mentioned pneumonia, partial lung collapse or blood clots in lungs. I then spoke with a primary care doc in my area, he wants me to have a different test taken, says the LA County mouth swabs are basically useless. Says that if it comes back negative her will order tests, but if its positive that these things all seem normal. I am now very confused by the conflicting medical advice...

Did people have a physical exam done/tests taken after a positive diagnosis? Or do you really just sit and wait until you can barely breathe to do anything?

,COVID19positive,"UPDATE: had a relapse five days ago that floored me. Chest pain lung pain. Just went in to get a test and the test was negative. Getting an antibody test in a few hours. Doctor prescribed an albuterol inhaler and said I likely had some lung damage due to covid. Thus far it seems to be helping lessen my lung and chest pain.

ORIG POST: Hey everyone! me and my wife both got corona symptoms on March 5 and 6 respectively. Quarantined immediately. My wife is a professional dancer, and I'm a daily exerciser. In reading what felt like all of the internet, until this board I realized that there didn't seem to be a lot being said about what it felt like to be sick, and that complicated our feelings about our own recovery. Should we still be feeling sick? Do we go to the ER? Are there even tests available? Is this even a symptom? Breaking out our symptoms for those who want a roadmap of what it has looked like for us. For the duration we've abstained from any and all alcohol. At the time of our symptoms outset, no tests were being given for people who had non-contact. 

DAY 1 and 2-- slight fever. chills. body ache. (oh shit, quarantine) 

DAY 3-7 - fever gone, but fatigue, sore back of throat. type of days where getting off the couch to get your own water felt like running a marathon.

DAY 8 - Add Gastrointestinal problems and abdominal pain to my symptoms. Talk to my physician cousin via facetime. He says, this sounds like COVID. stay put, monitor.

DAY 12 - here's where it got scary. chest pain and lightness of breath. began the solid week of ""Do we get a test? Oh none available, emergency room?!"". shortage of tests still happening (HOW?!) Our decision hinged on being able to consult with cousin physician. We took the trio of heart rate (below 100 bpm resting), breath rate (below 30 breaths per minute resting) and temperature (no fever). Oximeter would've been helpful but they're sold out here. But basically, our operating theory was, if we're not sure if they'll admit us into the hospital, then it is best to stay home and spare us and them the additional exposure and overload. 

DAY 17 - my gastroproblems are gone. thank god. 

DAY 19 - signs recovery for my wife... she starts light computer work, trying to train. i myself am feeling better. i'm able to sit AT my computer instead of the couch or bed. 

DAY 20 - just kidding, relapse for me. back to the couch. the fatigue feels overwhelming. i try to explain it to my cousin physician-- it feels like there's a soft, dull, sickness, behind my eyes and just in my blood and every breath. 

DAY 22 - my wife is starting her cycle. for one day, she takes her ibuprofen, before i catch her and switch her to tylenol. It's enough to where our resumed in mask dog walks (live in a private area) around the block felt like it might floor us. 

DAY 25 - i'm slowly getting better, but my wife appears to have completely new symptoms. this starts a week where every time she stands, she gets light-headed to the verge of passing out. DAY 28 - wife on verge of tears because of the duration of the illness, chest pain and acute back pain. said her symptoms felt different than her first fights. finally see a doctor at urgent care, because ERs slammed. Her oximeter says she has full 99% oxygen. vitals are strong. But a weird thing, when she stands up or down, her heart rate shoots from her normal resting of 60 bpm, to over 125 bpm. Anything more than a 30 bpm jump is considered abnormal. The poor urgent care doctor tries to diagnose her in addition to COVID with virally induced POTS or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. They're not administering tests except in the emergency room. I know about that syndrome and for a dancer who spends her life getting up and down from the floor, that seems highly unlikely. My wife points out that it seems, that doctors really don't have experience dealing with this. We decide that we're safe enough to not go to the ER, and that this is likely due to COVID. 

DAY 30 - turning point. wife feels like the illness has moved down her body. Pain moved to her ribs. Im able to do light housework and stretching.

DAY 31- tried a light 45 stretch class on instagram live. Absolutely floored me. Had to go to sleep after. Still having fatigue and a weird feeling in my chest. 

DAY 33 - both of us can have full but inactive days aka computer work actually able to do chores. was able to walk a mile and a half. still feel it, the inability to have endurance or any well of strength. Anyway, thanks for reading. Hang in there. We're going to keep taking care of ourselves. We hope you do the same. 

UPDATE: DAY 37- wife has relapse of chest pain. Decide to urgent care physician. She presumes us both positive, but no tests available.

DAY 38 Successfully went on a jog. Didn't feel bad during but...

DAY 39- 41 Lung pain and chest pain returned. Obviously too much too soon. 

DAY 44 Able to resume daily dog walks, wife able to make it through light ballet class 

DAY 45 Instead of cardio tried light weight work. Didn’t seem to affect covid, walks getting longer. Getting stronger. 

DAY 48 Wife has weird pain behind both of her knees. Gets checked out by a doctor to make sure not a clotting issue. 

DAY 50 split a beer. Doing light work outs, pull ups pushups etc. trying to not to get heart rate too high. 

DAY 51 Celebrated anniversary too vigorously too many times 

DAY 52 fatigue and weakness returned, a lot more couch lying than desk work.

DAY 53 full melt down. Unable to leave couch 

DAY 54 Feeling slightly better but wanting to rule out any infections on top of covid symptoms. Accessible testing available in my area. Consult with doctor via videoconference. Drive thru testing sight. The testing is super efficient and quick. Less than 5 minutes Nose swab and then opt into a clinical trial testing extra alternative swabs for the cause (apparently they’re running out of the primary use swabs) 

DAY 55 tears come back negative. Heading into appointment for doctor follow up and antibody test soon. Wife taking a moderated ballet class. Doctor says that a LOT of presumed COVID patients are getting new infections on top of their old infections. Administers blood antibody test.

DAY 56 Last night was hell. Chills, fever, whole nine. Got on the video phone with the doctor. Said to hang in there with tylenol and mucinex. Says i likely have something on top of what i had before because of a weakened immune system.

&lt;p&gt;ORIG POST: Hey everyone! me and my wife both got corona symptoms on March 5 and 6 respectively. Quarantined immediately. My wife is a professional dancer, and I&amp;#39;m a daily exerciser. In reading what felt like all of the internet, until this board I realized that there didn&amp;#39;t seem to be a lot being said about what it felt like to be sick, and that complicated our feelings about our own recovery. Should we still be feeling sick? Do we go to the ER? Are there even tests available? Is this even a symptom? Breaking out our symptoms for those who want a roadmap of what it has looked like for us. For the duration we&amp;#39;ve abstained from any and all alcohol. At the time of our symptoms outset, no tests were being given for people who had non-contact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY 1 and 2-- slight fever. chills. body ache. (oh shit, quarantine) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY 3-7 - fever gone, but fatigue, sore back of throat. type of days where getting off the couch to get your own water felt like running a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY 8 - Add Gastrointestinal problems and abdominal pain to my symptoms. Talk to my physician cousin via facetime. He says, this sounds like COVID. stay put, monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY 12 - here&amp;#39;s where it got scary. chest pain and lightness of breath. began the solid week of &amp;quot;Do we get a test? Oh none available, emergency room?!&amp;quot;. shortage of tests still happening (HOW?!) Our decision hinged on being able to consult with cousin physician. We took the trio of heart rate (below 100 bpm resting), breath rate (below 30 breaths per minute resting) and temperature (no fever). Oximeter would&amp;#39;ve been helpful but they&amp;#39;re sold out here. But basically, our operating theory was, if we&amp;#39;re not sure if they&amp;#39;ll admit us into the hospital, then it is best to stay home and spare us and them the additional exposure and overload. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY 17 - my gastroproblems are gone. thank god. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY 19 - signs recovery for my wife... she starts light computer work, trying to train. i myself am feeling better. i&amp;#39;m able to sit AT my computer instead of the couch or bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY 20 - just kidding, relapse for me. back to the couch. the fatigue feels overwhelming. i try to explain it to my cousin physician-- it feels like there&amp;#39;s a soft, dull, sickness, behind my eyes and just in my blood and every breath. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY 22 - my wife is starting her cycle. for one day, she takes her ibuprofen, before i catch her and switch her to tylenol. It&amp;#39;s enough to where our resumed in mask dog walks (live in a private area) around the block felt like it might floor us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAY 25 - i&amp;#39;m slowly getting better, but my wife appears to have completely new symptoms. this starts a week where every time she stands, she gets light-headed to the verge of passing out. DAY 28 - wife on verge of tears because of the duration of the illness, chest pain and acute back pain. said her symptoms felt different than her first fights. finally see a doctor at urgent care, because ERs slammed. Her oximeter says she has full 99% oxygen. vitals are strong. But a weird thing, when she stands up or down, her heart rate shoots from her normal resting of 60 bpm, to over 125 bpm. Anything more than a 30 bpm jump is considered abnormal. The poor urgent care doctor tries to diagnose her in addition to COVID with virally induced POTS or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.

,COVID19positive,"Had low grade fever for 6 weeks which kept going up and down through the day. This week it seems to go down if I take vit C, no longer take paracetamol, about 1000 mg vit C twice a day. It doesn't go over 37 celsius, that's 98.7 F. Had really bad GERD, stomach was burning all through week 5. I suffer from gastritis. I could barely eat as I was burping all the time after a meal. I found famotidine and peppermint tea helped. The cough was persistent until week 6. This week it seems to have gone away. I was constantly clearing my throat and spitting a gel like mucus with no color. I still do now, but it's much less compared to previous weeks. I had pins and needles in my upper chest, but not when breathing, sporadically and they seem to have gone away in week 5-6. I relapsed every week for various reasons: first time is was because I was slightly dehydrated, second time because I decided to clean the house and I was out of air and tired but pushed through it, third time because of coffee, fourth workout of 10 mins on the elliptical for two days in a row, sixth because I had a green tea and a strong coffee. You get the idea, any kind of workout would  throw me off.

This forum has really helped and I’ve read some people that are much worse and feel for them.

I keep going back and forth with trying to get blood work, more tests done to make sure I’m ok. I didn’t really have a primary doctor before this. I linked up with a doctor by phone but do not know him well. 

His advise is to stay home and not to risk going to hospital/clinic/doctors office. Says the risk of reinfection/getting something else is not worth the reward cause there are still so many unknowns with virus. And since I’m not really getting worse just to hang in there. I wasn’t even sure I could get to a doctor for blood work (not for covid testing, but to make sure heart/liver/kidneys/lungs are ok.) had two chest X-rays way back on day 1 and 10, and an ekg at day 10 that was clear.

,COVID19positive,"It started out with a slight cough, and extremely EXTREME exhaustion. I haven’t felt THIS exhausted since I was pregnant with my second and was diagnosed with hyperemisis. Like literally all I wanted to do was sleep. Barely would eat. Cough went from something light and every now and then to now a deep, painful, dry, sometimes white funk being spit up) cough. My throat feels SO tight it’s like breathing through a McDonald’s straw. I’ve smoked for 10 years and NEVER felt like this. I thought at first it was smokers cough. I told the doctors my symptoms, and had called dr on demand on this past Sunday; to get diagnosed with acute asthma exacerbation. I’ve NEVER been diagnosed with asthma in my entire life. 
The dr I saw in AFC urgent clinic on Monday said she was extremely worried bc this has gone on for at least 7-8 days, and with asthma, it’s usually gone by now, not getting worse. I have been turned away at work and told to call corporate. No payed leave. My son went to stay at his dads three weeks ago thank god. 
I’ve had no fever. No nausea or stomach problems, unless I cough so hard and so bad and so long I’m literally vomiting. No rash. Nothing other than this horrible swollen feeling in my throat and tightness in my chest and severe pain when I cough and hitching in my breathing; especially when I breath deeply in or out. I’m hoping this comes back negative. 
I picked up an inhaler that the online doctor prescribed and singular.

I haven’t felt THIS exhausted since I was pregnant with my second and was diagnosed with hyperemisis. Like literally all I wanted to do was sleep. Barely would eat. Cough went from something light and every now and then to now a deep, painful, dry, sometimes white funk being spit up) cough. My throat feels SO tight it’s like breathing through a McDonald’s straw. I’ve smoked for 10 years and NEVER felt like this. I thought at first it was smokers cough. I told the doctors my symptoms, and had called dr on demand on this past Sunday; to get diagnosed with acute asthma exacerbation. I’ve NEVER been diagnosed with asthma in my entire life. 
The dr I saw in AFC urgent clinic on Monday said she was extremely worried bc this has gone on for at least 7-8 days, and with asthma, it’s usually gone by now, not getting worse. I have been turned away at work and told to call corporate. No payed leave. My son went to stay at his dads three weeks ago thank god. 
I’ve had no fever. No nausea or stomach problems, unless I cough so hard and so bad and so long I’m literally vomiting. No rash. Nothing other than this horrible swollen feeling in my throat and tightness in my chest and severe pain when I cough and hitching in my breathing; especially when I breath deeply in or out. I’m hoping this comes back negative. 
I picked up an inhaler that the online doctor prescribed and singular.

So against her protests, my dad and I took out all the trash and all the food in the room but she said to absolutely not take the laundry. A few days passed but the smell was still there. I was really worried about her and tried convince her to let me clean up everything in the room and do her laundry (at a safe distance and with a mask and gloves) to give her a cleaner environment to rest in but she says to do it tomorrow and then tomorrow comes and then she says she's tired and to give her a break and then the next day comes and repeat.  She doesn't want to go to the hospital and I don't know what to fucking do. And every time I try to force myself in the room to help her clean up it stresses her out and then she starts to have a coughing fit and starts crying and then I force myself to go away. After that time we took out the trash, I keep telling her to give me the food she doesn't finish so it doesn't pile up and then I could properly throw it away but when I do that she starts crying and says she doesn't want to infect me. I don't know when she needs my help because she never calls me but I always try to check on her in the morning, afternoon and evening.  The thing is I can only check on her between my back-to-back lectures and with finals coming up I'm stressed the fuck out and this led to me falling behind on my work and studies. How do I balance taking care of my mom and my engineering classes? What should I do?

I started to suffer from the following symptoms aswell:

'Shortness of breath, light headedness, runny nose, flu, chest pain, coldness, chills'

Even though the symptoms for my cold subsided, my loss of smell and taste are still imminent. It's been a little more than a week since i lost them, and 2 weeks since the breathlessness began

I also felt a slight fever, and felt weak, but it went away in a day.

,COVID19positive,"This is a serious question from someone who is admittedly not very science-minded so please be gentle. 

I tested positive for COVID 9 days ago; symptoms began 14 days ago. I am already recovered. I know I need to stay self-isolated for a while longer.

Everything I’ve seen about wearing masks depicts the act as mostly benefiting those around you; I wear a mask so you don’t get sick. That’s great, I agree with that 100%. But what if I’ve already recovered?

Thank you to everyone that showed so much love and support! It felt great. So far I have not relapsed in any of my coronavirus symptoms, and feel great in that aspect. 

However, I now have experienced anaphylaxis-like reactions twice since 5/2 that put me in the ER. It definitely seems to be food related (I already have an easy to manage dairy allergy). My throat now gets tight and swollen, hives, hard to breathe, the whole thing. I have a short list of what I think it is and other items I’m suspicious about. I’m seeing an allergist tomorrow. 

The thing that makes it so strange is the timing. As soon as I get over corona, I now have this life threatening allergic reaction that doesn’t seem to be going away; out of left field. I’m just really curious to see if anyone else has heard of this type of thing in association with covid. With how finicky this virus is, and how little is known in the grand scheme of things, I doubt I can get an answer but thought it’d be worth checking out. 

Thanks!

,COVID19positive,"29F here, no previous health conditions.

The only fever I got was 37.6-37.9 for 2 days at the end of March. 

The symptoms I’ve had but they are gone now:
- some coughing 
- upper back/neck pain 
-fatigue (I mostly feel fine now with standard levels of energy)
-fits of “feeling weird” (dizzy and all over off) followed by intense shaking 
-palpitations 

The symptoms I still have:

- shortness of breath: at some point I thought it was gone, but then it came back..it’s not like I’m gasping for air, it just feels like every breath I take doesn’t give as much oxygen as it normally would 
- some chest pressure 
- mucus - it feels like it’s not in my lungs, but somewhere between my nose and throat 
- GI issues (unusually gassy sometimes +a lot of burping, some loose stools)
- sometimes feeling heat in my face 
- yesterday I got nasty herpes on my lip
- weird pains in my chest and back here and there, not long-lasting

At this point I’m mentally exhausted. I don’t know if it will be over some day. I’ve never been sick for so long. I’m not the same person I used to be - happy, bubbly and chatty. I cry several times a day - it’s just really scary to be sick with something no one knows how to cure..

-fits of “feeling weird” (dizzy and all over off) followed by intense shaking 
-palpitations &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symptoms I still have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shortness of breath: at some point I thought it was gone, but then it came back..it’s not like I’m gasping for air, it just feels like every breath I take doesn’t give as much oxygen as it normally would &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some chest pressure &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mucus - it feels like it’s not in my lungs, but somewhere between my nose and throat &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GI issues (unusually gassy sometimes +a lot of burping, some loose stools)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes feeling heat in my face &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yesterday I got nasty herpes on my lip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weird pains in my chest and back here and there, not long-lasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I’m mentally exhausted. I don’t know if it will be over some day. I’ve never been sick for so long. I’m not the same person I used to be - happy, bubbly and chatty. I cry several times a day - it’s just really scary to be sick with something no one knows how to cure..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have anyone here completely recovered after such long cases? Should I expect more symptoms to come? What helped you get through this?&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"I thought I would finally get on here and tell my story.

I am in Central Illinois where Covid cases have been rising dramatically in the past week. This all started for me on April 3rd when I contacted my doctor out of fear of Covid due to my heart condition (I have SVT). I attempted to escape to southern Illinois to my parents house but as an ""essential employee"" was only allowed two weeks off work. When I returned to work, literally one day later, I presented with a 103 fever and a nasty phlegm producing cough. I couldn't breathe. I immediately got tested for Coronavirus at the only clinic in town that would allow it. (no anti-body tests were available at this time). The hospital refused to see me and I was doing everything via telehealth at that time. They placed me on an inhaler which I found odd. I hadn't had an asthma attack in 20+ years. Those asthma attacks were bad. I was placed on oxygen once when I almost died in the car on the way to the hospital when I was in junior high. The doctor on the phone let me know that childhood asthma has been coming back for patients with covid-19. I had to drive 20 miles outside of town at this point to find a thermometer when mine broke. People had raided every store in the city for Thermometers, toilet paper, blood pressure cuffs, if it was related to bodily health, you name it, and it was gone.

At this point my anxiety was so bad, that I was having panic attacks due to everything going on. I calmed down significantly after this day and settled into my fate that I may  be sick with the virus.

Sure enough, three days later, I presented with asthma that morning and needed to hit the inhaler.

Then the confusion started. I was out of work for a week more (2.5 weeks at this point) and needed to go back. My test came back NEGATIVE from the clinic for Covid. I was shocked and immediately went back to work cautiously. At this time, my job (I work in leasing) decided to close to the public, but my coworkers and vendors still had to be in our small enclosed office together for hours at a time. Our office is literally the size of a medium sized living room. Our corporate office, although promising in EMAIL, never provided us gloves, hand sanitizer, or even hand soap. They operate remotely out of Pennsylvania. (They still haven't, we had to buy it ourselves). We took it upon ourselves to not work on Saturdays anymore and adjusted our own rules in house, including no more in person viewings of apartments, and no more tenants allowed to come into the office, except for move-ins.

When I returned to work, I felt great for a week. In this time I broke up with my ex and was forced to move into my own apartment. I had to visit 5 stores in the matter of 4 hours on that day, and the entire time I was paranoid. I had to sleep on my coworker's couch for that week and she had thrown a get together was 8 people in the house, completely non-nonchalant about the entire Covid situation. I was furious about it, but couldn't do much because I had run out of money to get a hotel room at that time. I kept my mouth shut.

By April 18th I moved everything into my apartment by myself except big furniture (that I still haven't bought) and noticed I was having a hard time breathing going up the stairs, that day was so bad, and the next morning in my  new apartment alone, I awoke completely unable to breathe with a fever of 101. I was weak, every joint in my body hurt, and I missed that day of work as well. I looked in the mirror and my normally olive toned complexion was pale as a ghost and I had the darkest circles under my eyes I had ever seen. I had a Pulse Oximeter shipped to me after doing some research online that day about silent Hypoxia.

Our office were all given a covert ultimatum from our corporate office that if anyone took off anymore unplanned work we would be in trouble. I went to work anyway the next day when my fever went down and have been to work ever since.

Every morning since the 18th the tele-health doctors have placed me on several different medications including more Albuterol, Mucinex, Zyrtec, Flonaze, two cortosteroids, free Nicotine patches to stop smoking and I take otc tylenol. I went to the clinic once, where a heavily PPE'd nurse listened to my lungs and stated that my left lung has severe bronchitis ""on the verge of pneumonia"" and that the asthma was making it all worse. I was informed to take my inhaler more often. My pulse ox at the clinic was 98% but had plummeted to 89% steady that night while laying down. It improved the next morning, and hasn't dropped that low again since.

I asked her if I had coronavirus while tears were pouring down my cheeks and her answer was, ""Probably, but we can't be sure. I work with patients everyday, I could have it, but we just don't know. The test you took, at that time, was only 60% accurate. Your asthma will kill you before Covid does. So let's get that under control"" Mind you, again, I hadn't had an asthma attack since 1998 when I was 12 years old. She stated to me ""Its a common misconception to think that childhood asthma goes away. It never does, sometimes it takes a severe illness or lung trauma to bring it back, and like in you, it did. The mixture of seasonal allergies, a virus you have, and the bronchitis brought it back. The virus may or may  not be Covid-19""

They linked me up with a Covid symptom hotline, where they call me at 4pm everyday and find out how I'm doing. I am presumed positive by 2 different doctors at this point. They will not give me a note to get out of work, and I'm still ill. The hospital considers you to be ""non-infectious"" 3 days after the resolution of a fever. The fever I had spiked one last time last Saturday, and I hope that is the end of it. There are so many different ""weak points"" in my mind where I could have caught the virus in the past month, who knows. I am presumed positive and am at some point this week going to get an antibody test done. My childhood asthma is back for what looks like permanently (I hope that isn't true), and GOOD NEWS, I quit smoking in all of this mess, because the thought of a cigarette scares the hell out of me.  Also good news, my SVT has not acted up (yet) during this, and I'm honestly surprised. The mucus I am producing is so thick in the mornings that I have to take the hottest shower possible and take a full Mucinex pill or I wouldn't be able to walk to the car for work. You can feel the mucus trying to settle deeper and deeper into the lungs if you don't cough it up. Night time and mornings are the worse, I have lost a lot of sleep, jolting awake at 4am gasping for air and reaching for my inhaler, I have literally never been so scared to take a deep breathe in my life, thinking it may be my last. I have lost 10 pounds and (of course), my dramatic ex wants to me to take him back after he broke up with me while I was going through the worse flu I've had in years.

One of our maintenance techs was placed in the hospital with liver and kidney failure three days ago out of the blue for no reason and the hospital never tested him for Covid. They stabilized him quickly, had to return to work TODAY still sick, on light duty. I fear he will be back in the hospital by tomorrow. Our property manager took 10 weeks off to ""be with her kids"" when she took a job in Chicago and sent her kids to live with family members, and our maintenance supervisor quit unexpectedly last week and here me and my fellow leasing agent/Friend are still chugging away in the office with lingering coughs and I still have severe mucus build in my upper airways. When I get my anti-body test done, I will let everyone know here, but this has been a hell of a ride and I want off the train.

If I come back negative for the anti-bodies, I am going to literally scream WTF out-loud.

&amp;#x200B;

If I do have covid-19. I can tell you this. I haven't had bad lung problems since I was a child, and I remember how bad they were. Asthma induced bronchitis combined with a virus as a kid caused me some BIG ISSUES. I have had many colds since, but this caused my adult sized lungs to revert to that of a child struggling to breathe. I never thought I would feel this again as an adult and I feel really bad for those that have severe pre-existing conditions like cancer or heart failure. I can 100% see how people are dying in large numbers due to this. My age and overall good health saved me. Smoking and childhood asthma brought me to the edge.

At this time, my job (I work in leasing) decided to close to the public, but my coworkers and vendors still had to be in our small enclosed office together for hours at a time. Our office is literally the size of a medium sized living room. Our corporate office, although promising in EMAIL, never provided us gloves, hand sanitizer, or even hand soap. They operate remotely out of Pennsylvania. (They still haven&amp;#39;t, we had to buy it ourselves). We took it upon ourselves to not work on Saturdays anymore and adjusted our own rules in house, including no more in person viewings of apartments, and no more tenants allowed to come into the office, except for move-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I returned to work, I felt great for a week. In this time I broke up with my ex and was forced to move into my own apartment. I had to visit 5 stores in the matter of 4 hours on that day, and the entire time I was paranoid. I had to sleep on my coworker&amp;#39;s couch for that week and she had thrown a get together was 8 people in the house, completely non-nonchalant about the entire Covid situation. I was furious about it, but couldn&amp;#39;t do much because I had run out of money to get a hotel room at that time. I kept my mouth shut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By April 18th I moved everything into my apartment by myself except big furniture (that I still haven&amp;#39;t bought) and noticed I was having a hard time breathing going up the stairs, that day was so bad, and the next morning in my  new apartment alone, I awoke completely unable to breathe with a fever of 101. I was weak, every joint in my body hurt, and I missed that day of work as well. I looked in the mirror and my normally olive toned complexion was pale as a ghost and I had the darkest circles under my eyes I had ever seen. I had a Pulse Oximeter shipped to me after doing some research online that day about silent Hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our office were all given a covert ultimatum from our corporate office that if anyone took off anymore unplanned work we would be in trouble. I went to work anyway the next day when my fever went down and have been to work ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every morning since the 18th the tele-health doctors have placed me on several different medications including more Albuterol, Mucinex, Zyrtec, Flonaze, two cortosteroids, free Nicotine patches to stop smoking and I take otc tylenol. I went to the clinic once, where a heavily PPE&amp;#39;d nurse listened to my lungs and stated that my left lung has severe bronchitis &amp;quot;on the verge of pneumonia&amp;quot; and that the asthma was making it all worse. I was informed to take my inhaler more often. My pulse ox at the clinic was 98% but had plummeted to 89% steady that night while laying down. It improved the next morning, and hasn&amp;#39;t dropped that low again since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked her if I had coronavirus while tears were pouring down my cheeks and her answer was, &amp;quot;Probably, but we can&amp;#39;t be sure. I work with patients everyday, I could have it, but we just don&amp;#39;t know. The test you took, at that time, was only 60% accurate. Your asthma will kill you before Covid does. So let&amp;#39;s get that under control&amp;quot; Mind you, again, I hadn&amp;#39;t had an asthma attack since 1998 when I was 12 years old. She stated to me &amp;quot;Its a common misconception to think that childhood asthma goes away. It never does, sometimes it takes a severe illness or lung trauma to bring it back, and like in you, it did. The mixture of seasonal allergies, a virus you have, and the bronchitis brought it back. The virus may or may  not be Covid-19&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They linked me up with a Covid symptom hotline, where they call me at 4pm everyday and find out how I&amp;#39;m doing. I am presumed positive by 2 different doctors at this point. They will not give me a note to get out of work, and I&amp;#39;m still ill. The hospital considers you to be &amp;quot;non-infectious&amp;quot; 3 days after the resolution of a fever. The fever I had spiked one last time last Saturday, and I hope that is the end of it. There are so many different &amp;quot;weak points&amp;quot; in my mind where I could have caught the virus in the past month, who knows. I am presumed positive and am at some point this week going to get an antibody test done. My childhood asthma is back for what looks like permanently (I hope that isn&amp;#39;t true), and GOOD NEWS, I quit smoking in all of this mess, because the thought of a cigarette scares the hell out of me.  Also good news, my SVT has not acted up (yet) during this, and I&amp;#39;m honestly surprised. The mucus I am producing is so thick in the mornings that I have to take the hottest shower possible and take a full Mucinex pill or I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to walk to the car for work. You can feel the mucus trying to settle deeper and deeper into the lungs if you don&amp;#39;t cough it up. Night time and mornings are the worse, I have lost a lot of sleep, jolting awake at 4am gasping for air and reaching for my inhaler, I have literally never been so scared to take a deep breathe in my life, thinking it may be my last. I have lost 10 pounds and (of course), my dramatic ex wants to me to take him back after he broke up with me while I was going through the worse flu I&amp;#39;ve had in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our maintenance techs was placed in the hospital with liver and kidney failure three days ago out of the blue for no reason and the hospital never tested him for Covid. They stabilized him quickly, had to return to work TODAY still sick, on light duty. I fear he will be back in the hospital by tomorrow. Our property manager took 10 weeks off to &amp;quot;be with her kids&amp;quot; when she took a job in Chicago and sent her kids to live with family members, and our maintenance supervisor quit unexpectedly last week and here me and my fellow leasing agent/Friend are still chugging away in the office with lingering coughs and I still have severe mucus build in my upper airways. When I get my anti-body test done, I will let everyone know here, but this has been a hell of a ride and I want off the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I come back negative for the anti-bodies, I am going to literally scream WTF out-loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I do have covid-19. I can tell you this. I haven&amp;#39;t had bad lung problems since I was a child, and I remember how bad they were. Asthma induced bronchitis combined with a virus as a kid caused me some BIG ISSUES. I have had many colds since, but this caused my adult sized lungs to revert to that of a child struggling to breathe. I never thought I would feel this again as an adult and I feel really bad for those that have severe pre-existing conditions like cancer or heart failure. I can 100% see how people are dying in large numbers due to this. My age and overall good health saved me. Smoking and childhood asthma brought me to the edge. God speed to you all.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fxxi7l/dad_on_vent_for_over_two_weeks_just_got_a_scary/) previously about my dad in another sub, but am moving over to this one as it seems to have more firsthand accounts. Here's his timeline so far -

Prior to COVID-19 my dad in his late 60s was very healthy - worked out jumping rope 4 times a week - but did have interstitial lung disease and scarring in his lungs. He was functioning normally, but he did have a chronic cough.

March 12 - started showing symptoms of COVID-19

March 19 - admitted to hospital

March 21 - received positive test result for COVID-19

March 23 - intubated and put on ventilator

April 10, 11, 15 - tested again for COVID-19, all three come back negative - though he's still in the COVID ICU at this point

April 20 - transitioned to tracheostomy, still on vent. Throughout that week, he started to wake up and was practicing on pressure support and doing breathing trials, overall showing gradual improvements

April 26 - dad went into septic shock (we think). His blood pressure went way down and they had to paralyze him and turn the vent back up to fio2 100% (it was previously at 35%). They changed all his lines and started him on broad-spectrum antibiotics, to which he responded fairly quickly, within 24 hours. Vitals have been stable since then

May 3 - hospital calls us and tells us he's not waking up the way they want him to, did a CT scan of his brain to check for stroke/bleeding and don't see it which was a huge relief to us.

&amp;#x200B;

Today is May 4, about a week since his septic setback and I think his 43rd day on the ventilator. The staff at the hospital don't sound overly optimistic about his prognosis so really we are looking for any reasons to hope that he can come back from this. His fio2 is down to 40% now and his oxygen saturation is 98%. He also developed a low-grade fever today, his white blood cell count went up slightly, and his inflammation markers are up a bit as well, so we are scared about another potential infection :(

Basically we are just really worried and looking for some support and hopeful stories that my dad can pull through. He is a super tough guy with a very strong will to live. We miss him like crazy in the house and just want him to come home. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Edited to add - palliative care just called us and told us that his prognosis is poor and that the ICU team doesn’t feel that he can recover at this point.

8 weeks ago started very mild and rare cough like feeling. Initially it was dry for couple of weeks and then with a bit productive for next 2-3 weeks and then went away.

7 weeks ago started occasional mild, localized chest pains which still continue. Couple of weeks ago there were two evening when it went from mild to moderate. So I visited ER. They did EKG, blood work (troponin tests), x-ray. Everything looked good.

Still have mild chest pains, but they seem even more mild now.

My body felt completely weak and I was not in the mood to do much despite me trying to be. I always wanted to be in my bed! I lost my appetite completely I’d try to eat but just couldn’t. I was drinking water like crazy and had one pedialyte and a few gatorades. My legs felt weak, my body was shaking and my body was aching bad. I have to admit I cried a few nights feeling hopeless. The headaches the first few days were intense. I remember at one point only one side of my face would ache. I could NOT sleep I also kept getting jerks when I tried to sleep. (I work at a grocery store btw) the off balance feeling was everyday standing up or laying down. My chest has also had a weird pressure to it. My legs were tingling bad. My ear would also ache and ring at certain times. After a few days of this mess I called my doctor and he said I should be self isolating and that it’s weird for it to be anything but COVID because flu season isn’t here anymore and I had the low grade fever. I also experienced a bit of pain in my legs. It has been 27 days with most of these symptoms. Throughout I have to say my nose has been very dry and I somewhat feel like I can’t hear as well as I use to. (Pressure in ears maybe not sure) Honestly everything is just dry. A few days ago the chest tightness was unbearable and i was experiencing upper back pain around where I think my kidneys are. I went to the hospital. (It still feels the same but the doctor said that everything looked fine.) I was experiencing tachycardia when I was at the hospital. (Got ct scan, blood work, and ekg). They said I should feel me heart pounding as fast as it was but I could not. 
I’m starting to wonder if this is really COVID but staying safe since my doctor thinks it is. He told me I can’t go back to work until 7 days of no symptoms. 

I’ve been around my family but no one is showing major symptoms. My mom did have weird hives though. My brother has experienced chest tightness a bit.

,COVID19positive,"I haven't been tested so of course people may be sceptical, but I had a flu-like illness which turned to shortness of breath after 9-10 days and there's a plausible chain of transmission, also my wife had symptoms at the same time. Doctor certainly thinks it's highly likely.

I've been working under the assumption this is basically a nasty viral pneumonia, and the shortness of breath would just take 6-12 weeks to clear up (based on normal pneumonia recovery length, I'm not a doctor but I know that's pretty common). Personally I've had no other symptoms since day 12 except respiratory (cough and SOB) and everything I'd experienced was consistent with that.

But starting on Friday I started to get worse again. Today I'm having to take extra large breaths about every 3rd breath, and even lying down it's not completely normal. I'd say I'm back to being about 50-75% of where I was at my worse, whereas for the last 2 weeks I'd got back to being about 95% better (only real lingering symptom was a bronchial-sounding cough, and even that seemed to be getting better).

Now...is this consistent with pneumonia, i.e. 10 slow steps forward, about 8 quick ones back, even this far in? Or is something stranger going on with this illness? I just don't understand how lungs that are slowly recovering (but no longer infected, assuming they're not), can relapse to that degree. And the weirdest thing is, my lungs themselves don't feel that tight any more, the cough isn't that bad or anything, I just ""need"" to breathe extra heavily.

I've noticed my heart rate is up a bit too, which hasn't happened since the first couple of weeks. I'm wondering about heart stuff, which is apparently quite common with Covid.

,COVID19positive,"Some good (?) news; I got bloodwork done to test for coronavirus antibodies a few days ago at CityMD, and the test came back positive today! It’s very scary to know that I had the virus at some point, especially because my mother, who had pneumonia as a child, exhibited very similar symptoms around the same time; but we are both functioning at 100% now. EDIT: I am 22, female, normal BMI, and exercise 3-4 times a week.

Around the end of March, I started feeling very sick- almost like the flu, but with weirder symptoms that didn’t quite fit the description of the flu. Being the neurotic person that I am, I kept a very detailed Google docs open to log my symptoms by the hour, and I wanted to share here so people can see another set of symptoms experienced. I shortened it for the sake of the post. I was tired and sick for about 2 weeks total, but the first week was when all the major symptoms showed.

Day 1: Began feeling a massive, throbbing headache, pressure in my head, mild body aches and chills. Body temperature going up. Hard to sleep; tossed and turned. 

Day 2: Woke up in the middle of the night with aches and chills. Still have immense pressure in head with icepick migraines. Slight cough, but no pressure in chest. Could not sleep. Progressively got worse throughout the day, even though there were moments I felt fine, like when I logged in for work and attended a dance livestream. Developed a high fever towards the evening. Felt nauseous and vomit-y. Lots of chills and aches, with a little bit of a cough. Took Tylenol throughout the day. Soaked through my shirt with sweat from fever. Did not catch any sleep. Super cranky at this point, wanted to fight coronavirus with my bare fists.

Day 3: Fever going down. Less headaches. Had severe diarrhea at this point; no food stayed down, and I felt like vomiting every time I sat down on the toilet. Felt a little pressure on my chest when I lied down, but this might have been placebo. No appetite at all. Cried a lot from feeling fatigued. Told myself to get over it and stop being so emotional over a virus.

Day 4: Migraines are mostly gone. A lot less head tension and pressure than a few days ago. Lost 6 lbs from lack of food and constant diarrhea. This is the point where I lost my sense of smell and taste completely. I will never take smell and taste for granted again.

Day 5: Developed really painful canker sores in my mouth that prevented me from eating further. No fever or headaches at this point, and diarrhea seems to have stopped as well. 

It took until Day 10 to recover my sense of taste and smell, and for the sores in my mouth to go away. The whole time, I took a concoction of Tylenol and antibiotics to help with the pain. I don’t know if it helped, but it certainly did seem to relieve symptoms faster.  I lost a total of 8 lbs from this (although it bounced back just as quickly once I started being able to eat normally again). The presence of diarrhea made me think this was a stomach bug at first, but the loss of smell and taste definitely raised warning bells for me.

,COVID19positive,"Hi there. I started suffering from Covid like symptoms at the beginning of April and had a zoom appointment with my doctor, and was diagnosed with likely Covid19. And I have to say, it was the roughest illness I have ever had and I was considering going to the ER more than once because I was so short of breath that I was getting very dizzy and I was afraid of suffocating in my sleep. 

While I never did develop a fever, my other symptoms included 

- very dry cough that still lingers to this day, was so bad that I had to use an inhaler
- gastrointestinal distress, food and drink that I used to have no issue with gave me, well, distress
- extreme fatigue on the worst days, I slept like 16 hours one day, but that could have been the z-pac I started taking
- chest tightness and pressure, like someone was sitting on my chest and I could not take a full breath

a mask we didn’t have a clue how to monitor him what we should do how do u check his blood pressure what if his thin breathing gets worse anyway me being in a kind of mind set we’re nothing has went right for me in the last five years quick recap I got my flat flooded by a tenant up the stairs my fiancé at the time was pregnant I worked three jobs living in her single bed finally after a long fight with housing ex over that my son has to be born for me to get any points of them even tho they made me basically homeless 9 months later it came to the best day of my life the birth of my son he was born after a really hard labour for my ex which that I will always show my love for. the only thing I could do now was provide a house a home and try and build my family I’m a very start to finish guy no in between we went from labour straight to the certificate center and got my childs certificate I dropped my fiancé to her mothers with the light of my life and then went into what I would call daddy mode I worked so hard three jobs and my rising own business I couldn’t get a mortgage due to past debt so I went straight to the housing with the certificate as I knew they were building property’s in the town my ex fiancé grew up and still we had to go for two months with a new born in a single bed I thought I was tired when I partied this was on a hole knew level I was feeding the child in my sleep hearing him every peep eventually housing contacted me to inform me that I successfully got one of the property’s so moved in straight away it was a blank canvis but I can see my fiancé isn’t like she used to be she’s yelling and angry annoyed at everything and everyone she didn’t want to pick floors wallpaper fridges freezers carpet anything she changed as I’m still working I put everything I had into building this home calling in favours from friends and family that without them I could never had done what was down the house was painted furnished floored within a week for the hole week I slept on the floor of the half built house no bed yet or anything while the ex had the child in her mums the house got up and running but I could see my fiancé wasn’t the same I googled a lot about her reactions towards the child me and everyone to that matter postnatal depression kept arising I tryed to understand it in many many forms of reading I would get calls while I’m work the childs not well u need to get home 3 in the morning get home now the childs sick I worked night shifts  day shifts and some weekends the housing building costed the ups of 15 grand which for me is a hell of lot of money my fiancé one morning handed me my son while I was working in a sales place I had to get a 7 am bus as I didn’t drive so I was up at half 6 my ex fiancé came down the stairs handed me my son who was about 5/6 months and jumped in another mans car outside my house i had to ring my boss and tell him I was so much all about being a good dad and being the best for him maybe I didn’t do enough for her that is just a we tale into that so i got depressed and because I wasn’t from her town her family made sure to let me no that it should be her in the house as her family lived in the street I sat for about three months with no job  and a gorgeous child who I just wanted to protect so I asked her if she’s signs to give me my son 3 a half days a week she can keep the house she made a deal moved into the house and never signed anything to give me my child for half the week her reasons was she will lose her benefit I moved to my mother and fathers I fought in court for three years maybe 4 with no job as I couldn’t afford the fees of going thru court when court passed I got my son for 2 and half days a week I got back to work straight away in new hopes of getting a mortgage after long struggles with depression I was doing well as vaulter in a big company things were looking up and then was in a horrible car crash that I have never recovered from mentally at nights it’s crazy I think it’s more that the guy who did it had his full beam and the hole way on my approach I pass this guy and go head first into a stock car in a dark road then the car with beams takes off did he know that the stock car was on my side of the road did he try and kill me all these unanswered questions that still play on me by the way I came into information that the guy who drove away is my ex’s uncle yeah crazy I know anyway months went by my back neck sleep bones felt so weak I couldn’t vault no more so I moved to a new job just driving I thought which was actually more labour for less money and all I kept thinking was move forward this is the job I was in up to 22nd March when they fired me..So my head with a sick father who’s out of work is layin in bed my mother out of work my brother and me and I’m 27 so I’m expected to be a provider days go on after my fathers birthdays and I could see him getting weaker and weaker instead of better the docs were ment to come out on a Friday and check on him but they didn’t have the equipment to come out to him on that Friday  night early hours we had to had to ring an ambulance my dad couldn’t lift his head his breathing was now a wezz his hand was laying there  hanging of the bed I was holding his hand he tryed to squeeze it back but it was like a child gripping ur finger I told him daddy we need to ring the ambulance he was trying to say no but he couldn’t talk I knew he could hear me he just couldn’t speak I thought I was losing my father there I broke I told him ur grandson needs u and I need u we still need to do something for him please daddy as I’m in bits holding my father my mother is outside crying waiting on the ambulance a concerned neighbour who works for the nhs was asking what he’s ate and drank which was next to nothing he could barely swallow so she ran in the house and lifted honey she said hear i soaked at in a bit of hot water try give him even a spoon full just to try get something in him so I’m trying to tell my dad the ambulance is coming I’m scarred so I’m telling him I’m not letting him go on his own I’m going to be with him but we have to go he’s

comes up the stairs and asked me to leave and wait on the ambulance as she could see my held back tears with water and honey my mother told my father he has to drink this and try a spoon of this I went out for a smoke while my younger brother was there we sat silently beside each other looking at the road that could potentially be the last time we see our father family gather in cars and concerned neighbours outside my mother came down the stairs and said he da said he’s not going my dad got really freaked out the last time he got put in hospital by getting told he might not make 24 hours the doc actually told him to tell the family to make preparations I said to my mum what hows he speaking I went up and there was my father with his eyes open telling me he’s not going I was in shock It was like he just found this new lease of life so the ambulance came up and ran tests on him to hear him talk to the ambulance man when he couldn’t even lift his head to me was so baffling I was asked to leave from the ambulance man and then he came down the stairs and I asked him how is he the doc says his breathing is better than it was when he first went into hospital that his blood pressure was fine we weee in shock the next day we found out that wa the doctor said to my daddy in hospital was true and he was diabetic they knew from January it’s now April and this is when he gets told I had to go get heart monitors sugar level reader everything my father is now on the mend but we are still recovering they usejng his antibodies to fight the virus but can someone give me advice

,COVID19positive,"Hello - Wondering if there's anyone familiar with the COVID Rapid Antibody Tests. I know there's still a lot of questions out there, but maybe someone has some insight.

I was sick from about March 19th thru March 22nd with some cold like symptoms. My partner became ill about 10 days prior with the same, although more pronounced, illness. I also had a bad cold/flu/something in mid-January. But, after March, neither of us had any cold symptoms. We didn't take tests at that time because of availability (although my partner did a Telehealth appointment and it was their opinion he didn't have it).

Anyhow, I saw that my local urgent care is offering RayBiotech COVID Rapid Antibody tests. I took the test April 27th and it came back positive but only for the IgM antibody. The PA mentioned the COVID episode was likely the latter illness in March since I'd probably produce IgG antibodies if I was ill before that.

Today, my partner took the same test and also only tested positive for the IgM antibody. Based on the paperwork, IgM is visible after 5-14 days and IgG is produced 3-5 days after that.

It seems odd that IgG would be negative if we both had COVID in early to mid-March. And it's possible those were just colds and we were exposed and asymptomatic afterwards. But, to maybe get some insight, is it possible the IgG just won't show up or this particular test/brand is not the most sensitive?

,COVID19positive,"39m, no underlying conditions, sick only once in the last 13 years. Have to summarize my experience. 

So this last Tuesday I felt a tickle in my throat. It escalated continually, but without much of a fever at all, till Thursday morning when I felt very dizzy, like right before fainting, but not fainting. Shallow, fast breathing. Collapsed in the hallway, threw up, sweating profusely, both hands tingled then went numb and tensed up like claws. Feet went numb soon after, then legs and arms. Couldn’t move. No control. Panic. I think I am dying and my 9yo is witnessing it. Ambulance. Emergency Room. Positive for Covid19. Good oxygen saturation. Thinking about a will, and not even seeing my kids and wife again before I die slowly.

During my two nights there I never felt as bad again, sometimes completely healthy, most of the time one or two different symptoms. Not much sleep past 20min here and there. Sent home, with 4 weeks worth of anti coagulant shots, on third day since all blood tests after Thursday had come back good/excellent.

First day home, good, a little cold sweat. Slept great. Second day (today), stomach upset in the morning, then good, but tired. Around 9pm started feeling chest pain, both like a pressure and as something going on inside my lungs maybe. it escalates, maybe, might be me worrying. Very hard to not focus completely on the pain and scaring the hell out of myself.

I know about the roller coaster ride of symptoms, I know it gets worse in the mornings and evenings, but I also know that no one actually knows anything, it could come back worse, it could go away. So it’s like I’m running through every scenario and the ones that feel feasible are the ones where the whole ordeal starts over from the beginning and ends with me dying.

Wish there was a hotline to call, where I could talk to others who have gone through it all. That could calm me or just talk to me because I can’t stop worrying or worse. Reading post after post about people with severe symptoms after week 8 is not helping.

,COVID19positive,"Hi all,

I wanted to share an update from my case. I got the results from my test (nose swab), and it came back negative, without much surprise (it was taken on day 41). My symptoms are still there (fatigue, fever, oppression in the chest, headaches), although they seem to be diminishing slowly. I am wondering if this means that the virus is out of my body? Or if it just means it is not as active anymore, or was a false negative or something? They are not doing antibodies tests in my area, and my GP is pretty sure that I had (have?) indeed the coronavirus.

The only things that worry me now are the weird chest pains (mostly on the left side, not moving, and wakes me up at night), did any of you suffer from that one too? Do you know what are the signs that the virus had impact on your heart? For a bit of background, cardiac disease runs high in my family, so I am slightly anxious about them.

But anyway, keeping my fingers crossed that this is just my anxiety expressing itself and that I will be perfectly fine in a couple of days or a week or so. When that happens at least I'll know the virus is completely out!

The antibody test(IgG serology) I got at City MD for free suggested that I have antibodies for SARS-COV-2.  This is not necessarily a true positive nor can I assume I have immunity to reinfection for various reasons.

What were my symptoms?

Headaches starting March 12
Lost smell/taste March 20
Nose and Sinus Inflamed but no mucus or drip whatsoever Normally I get sinusistis often and there of buckets of postnatal drips. Yeah it’s nasty af. I was shocked that my nose was completely blocked but snotless and no clearing of the throat.
Cough- slightly? I used my inhaler more than normal during this time.  
No fever - but the weekend of March 20 I was extremely sleepy.  Not like “oh boy I am tired” like I could not NOT fall asleep and napped on and off. 

My roomates had no symptoms.  A close friend I hang with often had the same symptoms at the same time. 

I took allergra and Sudafed daily bc I believed I had allergies.  I stopped taking these on March 28 when I smelled garlic finally.  I stopped taking these and I was fine.. just the normal pollen Induced itchiness. I haven’t used my inhaler since April 5th or so...

Bio nerds: 
I am also on xolair which blocks IgE, this is regarded by some professionals as “immunosuppressive” however some say it would help with covid19 bc it can block interluekin 3/4 that can produces cytokines. 

I believe I got this disease when I rubbed my eyes on the subway on March 10.  But who knows. 12 years old cough in my face all year long.

,COVID19positive,"Im a foreign student studying in the UK. Since the UK went into lockdown, I've self isolated myself and only had deliveries and such. Never went out once. 

Everything felt fine until one day suddenly I get a sore throat. Gargled some saltwater and it went away. Again I get it the next day, took some paracetamol cuz apparently ibuprofen does jack shit against this virus. At this point I'm suspecting something but not fully convinced. 

Then I fucked up...
To catch up with Uni work I invited my friend over (who was and is fine btw) and we sat down across the table and did some work. The next day was particularly beautiful so I went for a jog and did some light exercises in the park. 

Then it started happening. My chest felt tight. I couldn't breathe. Sore throat. At this point I'm panicking. Holy shit, do I have the virus? How did I catch it? When did I catch it? 

I had a nasty flu back in February. All of the symptoms matched Covid-19 but my GP told me it wasn't the virus. Again the cases were much lower back then in the UK. Didn't get tested as well. 

But damn the flu almost killed me. Couldn't stop coughing and my taste and smell disappeared for a solid month. Mucus buildup was permanent. High fever gave me insomnia as well. 

Okay now back to the present day. I'm convinced that the flu was actually the virus itself. But due to lack of testing and the general chill atmosphere the UK was portraying, nobody panicked. But now I was. 

Called my GP and he told me to self isolate and get an appointment for testing ASAP. But I couldn't do the latter so I was fucked indefinitely. 

Okay here's the good news to you people who are going through the same scenario, presumably:

I am back home. Left the UK three days ago. Got tested yesterday and it came back negative. I was just feeling anxious about the whole thing and that maybe contributed to my chest and breathing problems. The flu was just a nasty flu thats it. Will get tested again in mid May. Will keep you guys updated.

,COVID19positive,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

**I have been at my wits end for the past almost 3 months &amp; have no idea what I have.**

I'm a 22 year old male, completely healthy no prior conditions at all.

*It all started with groin pains in the beginning. Weirdest set of symptoms such as testicle aching, pubic mound area feeling discomfort, spreading to flank area &amp; lower abdomen.*

Like any normal person I thought its a urologic issues &amp; got it checked out for testicular issues as well as kidney issues. Everything including ultrasounds,etc came back fine.

&amp;#x200B;

**While this is happening I start developing new symptoms:**

&amp;#x200B;

* a mild dry cough. no coughing fit, just a small one that will come for no reason. Over the week\\s it developed to a real dry cough that when I did cough, it was more deep. But again nothing super heavy, just came on here &amp; there.
* Another set of symptoms also mounted on over time. My armpit/chest skin felt like it was burning. most oddest sensation that'd come and go.
* A week or so after that I found myself waking up with my ribs feeling like they're on fire. Super tender and bruised up to touch.
* I'd also wake up with my hip bones hurting from sleeping (never happened before but now was happening regularly at that point in time)
* Eventually there came a point where I would wake up some days with my lungs hurting. Aching as if I just recovered from 2 months of a respiratory illness. The lungs felt as if someone had punched them for so long, just so inflamed, heavy,tired lungs. Super uncomfortable.

*In fact if  I bended my body while this was happening it'd feel like my lungs were folding (weird I know).*

* Then later on started developing super clear white mucus. But not when coughing.  Just while chilling, I could feel it in my throat and able to produce white mucus completely.
* Shortly after more symptoms happen, loss of appetite, nausea, dizziness...they'd come and go. they'd last for 1-2 days disappear for a week then come and hit me hard again. At one point had runny diarrhea but lasted a bit, lots of bloating,etc
* And then to top it off one last new symptom was added. Back pain.

Weirdest back pain. Not related to posture or lifting/exertion. The type that can come on while you're laying down for no reason. It'd start in the left region mainly but can sometimes spread to entire back, making the whole back ache as if I messed it up.

Sometimes burning sensation.

Sometimes back would have stabbing sensation

sometimes it'd feel like a sore achy back as if I had finished working out and doing a good back exercise

&amp;#x200B;

**And here is the kicker**

&amp;#x200B;

* My groin symptoms which had tormented me for more than 5-6 weeks and started it all has vanished over 6 weeks+ ago. That was my initial concern.
* The other kicker is a lot of these symptoms come and go. One or more symptoms can sometimes go dormant and disappear for a while.
* Or sometimes you'll have a full day or two or sometimes a full week of feeling normal and symptoms come back.

&amp;#x200B;

**Right now what I've been stuck with for the past 4 weeks is the back pain that'd come on randomly, the rib tenderness &amp; pain that will come but sometimes go dormant, the armpit burning sensation, neck stiffness, and super mild dry cough that appears every few days at this point.**

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of tests so far, have done alot...complete blood count,blood panels, testicular ultrasound, kidney ultrasound, abdomen &amp; pelvis ct scan, chest xray, abdomen &amp; pelvis mri

&lt;li&gt;Then later on started developing super clear white mucus. But not when coughing.  Just while chilling, I could feel it in my throat and able to produce white mucus completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortly after more symptoms happen, loss of appetite, nausea, dizziness...they&amp;#39;d come and go. they&amp;#39;d last for 1-2 days disappear for a week then come and hit me hard again. At one point had runny diarrhea but lasted a bit, lots of bloating,etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then to top it off one last new symptom was added. Back pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weirdest back pain. Not related to posture or lifting/exertion. The type that can come on while you&amp;#39;re laying down for no reason. It&amp;#39;d start in the left region mainly but can sometimes spread to entire back, making the whole back ache as if I messed it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes burning sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes back would have stabbing sensation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sometimes it&amp;#39;d feel like a sore achy back as if I had finished working out and doing a good back exercise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And here is the kicker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My groin symptoms which had tormented me for more than 5-6 weeks and started it all has vanished over 6 weeks+ ago. That was my initial concern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other kicker is a lot of these symptoms come and go. One or more symptoms can sometimes go dormant and disappear for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or sometimes you&amp;#39;ll have a full day or two or sometimes a full week of feeling normal and symptoms come back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right now what I&amp;#39;ve been stuck with for the past 4 weeks is the back pain that&amp;#39;d come on randomly, the rib tenderness &amp;amp; pain that will come but sometimes go dormant, the armpit burning sensation, neck stiffness, and super mild dry cough that appears every few days at this point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of tests so far, have done alot...complete blood count,blood panels, testicular ultrasound, kidney ultrasound, abdomen &amp;amp; pelvis ct scan, chest xray, abdomen &amp;amp; pelvis mri&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So does this sound anything like covid since I haven&amp;#39;t gotten tested for it yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Symptom Duration : 52 days

Most of my symptoms have cleared up and overall I’ve been feeling better however I have two symptoms that persists and have been troubling me. 

First is elevated heart rate (will hit the 90s) but more specifically my heart rate will randomly spike to 130+ from time to time, almost always when I’m at rest, doing nothing at all. Is this common? It doesn’t feel like a panic attack, I have no sense of dread or worry. I’m usually totally chill before it happens. 

Second, I feel a weird “pressure” in my neck face and ears. Specifically, it feels like the lymph nodes under my jaw are swollen alongside a persistent tension in my neck. It almost feels like I’m wearing a tight scarf and the pressure extends up into the ears. The best way I can describe it is imagine the blood pressure higher in your head than your body. It feels slightly like I’m bent over and then blood rushes to your head. That same feeling. This feeling is greatly enhanced when I have the above referenced heart rate spike.

,COVID19positive,"My father (63) came down with a fever (Monday) March 16th and tested positive that Thursday. He spent 10 days isolating at home, followed by a 14 day stint in the hospital, and past several weeks continuing to isolate in one room at home. My mother (62) and I take care of him but have limited our contact with him, and wear an N95, gloves and a raincoat when going in his room. My mother and I tested negative (me, twice by swab and once by antibody, although I have had an unexplained fever , body aches and cough for 3 weeks), and my grandmother (87) tested positive but hasn't had a single symptom (maybe she's false positive). 

&amp;#x200B;

Given tomorrow marks week 7, my father can't believe he's still contagious and is forcibly making his way downstairs.

I need a gd hug, if anything. One hug a day from someone else would be great, like hug for a few seconds once a day, and then whoever can go somewhere else and leave me to my quarantining. It sounds silly, but thinking about it is like...really wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want any advice. I’m taking a daily vitamin. I go outside every day and sit for a bit on the porch. I expose myself to the sun when the sun is out. I drink a lot of water. I’m not deficient on electrolytes. My bloodwork is fine. No pneumonia whatsoever. No bacterial infection. No bronchitis or sinusitis or whatever -itis. I’ve been to the ER. I’ve been to the clinic. There isn’t much else I can do. I’m sad. Thanks for listening to my sad rambling.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Hello! I am posting because I am curious as to the communities experience with THC while positive for covid. I personally am positive on day 23 of symptoms and was previously a heavy marijuana smoker, so to avoid feeling awful on top of my symptoms I decided to infuse around 6 grams of wax into olive oil. 

I was experiencing breathing problems, low grade fever and chills from day 1, however around day 12 I started to get better. I was back to eating 5 meals a day, and my only discomfort was my lungs, even my fever dissipated. I continued using thc and took a turn for the worse again around day 18 and have discontinued using thc as I feel I was quite foolish and should have just stopped in the beginning. 

I know that THC has immunosuppressive and anti inflammatory properties. My treatment now includes oxygen tank (more for comfort, my oxygen levels are between 94-97) and hydroxychloroquine. I am intrigued because hydroxychloroquine is an immunosuppressive drug as well, so I’m curious if the thc actually did not have a negative effect and it was potentially my second wave of symptoms coming on.

Mine didn’t entirely align with the top 3 the CDC listed and the media pushed. I have not had a fever, just elevated body temp that comes and goes. And no dry cough. The chest pressure has been insane, and it can surge and feel like an elephant is sitting on you. And the shortness of breath is bad. I limit how much I talk. I have the GI symptoms and someone wrote gurgling sounds, that’s exactly it with loose stools. Also have the chills, night sweats, sinus headaches, ear aches, nasuea, weight loss, fatigue and muscle aches. When the chest pressure gets so high and diaphragm moving fast, I went to the ED. They screen out for heart attack and pneumonia, and say, with your family history of heart disease, get a stress test. I found this amusing as I cant even climb a flight of stairs without being seriously winded and I am in good shape. And no doc in the ED listened to my lungs.

,COVID19positive,"29F here, no previous health conditions.

On March 29th I got real bad back and neck stiffness, then on March 30th I got feverish (37.6-37.9), the fever lasted 2 days. Since then my symptoms include: 
- some coughing (especially in the morning, it disappeared about 2 weeks ago)
- pressure in my chest (constant pressure disappeared about 2 weeks ago though it still re-emerges sometimes)
- upper back/neck pain (real pain disappeared about a week ago, though some stiffness remains)
- shortness of breath (it comes it goes: as I’m typing this I definitely feel NOT ok with my breath though I felt it disappeared about a week ago; now it’s back!)
- GI issues (unusually gassy sometimes + A LOT of burping)
- fatigue - it comes and goes as well: one minute I feel perfectly fine, and the next minute I feel exhausted
- occasional blurry vision 
- some chills
- sometimes feeling heat in my face (no other ways to explain it-it’s kinda like the thing a city dweller feels after spending the whole day in the countryside)
- simply not feeling ok sometimes - as if I’m about to faint

The worst thing about all this is having no one to talk to. ER told me that I’m “just nervous”. Now my husband thinks so too. For the first couple of weeks he didn’t leave my side, always worried something really bad may happen to me, which exhausted him mentally. I’ve stopped discussing my symptoms with him since he had a major meltdown. I can’t tell my parents about this as well - I simply can’t put them through it. At first some doctors told me it can be a mild COVID-19 case, now (as so much time has passed) no one believes me, saying it’s just anxiety. So it’s just you, guys.

He was out of work for over a week, and eventually was given an albuterol inhaler. Was told by his doctor they were worried it might develop into pneumonia. At the time, he told me there were a few nights he was actually scared to go to sleep because he was worried he might not wake up due to the SOB. It lingered for several weeks. He's 37, and generally healthy.

A few days after his return to work, I (F, 44) got sick. I looked back at my texts calling out of work, so I know it started on January 12.

,COVID19positive,"I've been the sickest I've ever been in my life at this point. Please see my post history for a full run down of symptoms and progression but basically I'm still having lung attacks where I can't breath more than 20% capacity and my lungs feel like tire rubber. I'm also having neurological issues that have essentially left me feeling brain damaged. If you have an understanding of CFS/ME symptoms; that's what I'm dealing with.

I'm unable to do anything but look after myself day to day. My business has gone out the window. I can't manage to get out to do shopping at this point because I'm so dizzy/confused, physically weak and breathless. 

Yesterday I asked my doctor for a CT scan referal as my lungs have got worse in the last week after not improving but staying stable for a while. 52 days and I'm still struggling to breathe like 'I can't talk, need to save my breath' can't breathe for hours on end. The doctor refused to refer me. Instead she would refer me to a 'medically unexplained illness clinic' ... essentially a mental health department with talking therapies. Sorry, since when was being unable to breathe through physical ailments medically unexplainable?

The UK is rife with a lack of understanding and diamisal. Comments like ""if you're under 45 you're fine. You'll experience a minor illness"". I'm 26 was previously working out 5x a week and counting my diet intake / macros. At a guess I'd say I was healthier than 70% of the general population in my age group so how can anyone assume long term saftey of any age at this point?

Why is the media focusing on the mortality figure for the old and the infirm when it should be educating on the potential long term health risks to all ages. Its leading to complacency in the younger demographic rather than adherence to self safety measures.

No, I dont want to breed fear, but a sense of blissful ignorance is not the answer; Ignorance of the situation is how we got so deep into this mess in the first place. 

It's dangerous to minimise the severity of this illness for those infected who need support and validation to heal. It's also dangerous to encourage complacency in all ages in favour of a positivity bias. Alot of people here in the UK are behaving as if this is nothing more than a minor ailment, it's shocking.

I'm tired of being personally ignored and hearing all ages of people laugh or downplay the dangers of this illness for the young and healthy when I'm sat here looking at a life that will never be what it could of been before I got infected. They have no idea how lucky they are to have good health! 

Is anyone else experiencing the same dismissal and disbelief from those around them? 

Is anyone else still going on 8+ weeks dealing with this?

Edit: I wrote this yesterday morning. Over night last night, I'm pretty sure I had a heart attack. I have no idea how I survived what ever it was. Feel like I'd rather I didn't so I don't have to have another round of what ever that was.

It felt like boiling water being poured onto my heart. My heart now sounds like it's fluttering on some beats causing 3 contractions instead of 2.

Please see my post history for a full run down of symptoms and progression but basically I&amp;#39;m still having lung attacks where I can&amp;#39;t breath more than 20% capacity and my lungs feel like tire rubber. I&amp;#39;m also having neurological issues that have essentially left me feeling brain damaged. If you have an understanding of CFS/ME symptoms; that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m unable to do anything but look after myself day to day. My business has gone out the window. I can&amp;#39;t manage to get out to do shopping at this point because I&amp;#39;m so dizzy/confused, physically weak and breathless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I asked my doctor for a CT scan referal as my lungs have got worse in the last week after not improving but staying stable for a while. 52 days and I&amp;#39;m still struggling to breathe like &amp;#39;I can&amp;#39;t talk, need to save my breath&amp;#39; can&amp;#39;t breathe for hours on end. The doctor refused to refer me. Instead she would refer me to a &amp;#39;medically unexplained illness clinic&amp;#39; ... essentially a mental health department with talking therapies. Sorry, since when was being unable to breathe through physical ailments medically unexplainable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is rife with a lack of understanding and diamisal. Comments like &amp;quot;if you&amp;#39;re under 45 you&amp;#39;re fine. You&amp;#39;ll experience a minor illness&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m 26 was previously working out 5x a week and counting my diet intake / macros. At a guess I&amp;#39;d say I was healthier than 70% of the general population in my age group so how can anyone assume long term saftey of any age at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is the media focusing on the mortality figure for the old and the infirm when it should be educating on the potential long term health risks to all ages. Its leading to complacency in the younger demographic rather than adherence to self safety measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I dont want to breed fear, but a sense of blissful ignorance is not the answer; Ignorance of the situation is how we got so deep into this mess in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s dangerous to minimise the severity of this illness for those infected who need support and validation to heal. It&amp;#39;s also dangerous to encourage complacency in all ages in favour of a positivity bias. Alot of people here in the UK are behaving as if this is nothing more than a minor ailment, it&amp;#39;s shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of being personally ignored and hearing all ages of people laugh or downplay the dangers of this illness for the young and healthy when I&amp;#39;m sat here looking at a life that will never be what it could of been before I got infected. They have no idea how lucky they are to have good health! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is anyone else experiencing the same dismissal and disbelief from those around them? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is anyone else still going on 8+ weeks dealing with this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I wrote this yesterday morning. Over night last night, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I had a heart attack. I have no idea how I survived what ever it was. Feel like I&amp;#39;d rather I didn&amp;#39;t so I don&amp;#39;t have to have another round of what ever that was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt like boiling water being poured onto my heart. My heart now sounds like it&amp;#39;s fluttering on some beats causing 3 contractions instead of 2. I can barely move but I&amp;#39;m scared to call for paramedics since when I did before they dismissed me and made me uncomfortable. No idea how I have made it through the night.

,COVID19positive,"I wanted to write this to help inform anyone who might be in a similar situation. Here’s my timeline from first onset and a list of symptoms. I have not been tested but I was officially diagnosed as positive by a doctor based on my symptoms – she said it’s highly unlikely that I don’t have it. They’re apparently only testing health care workers in my province so I’m not eligible. I just turned 26 and I’m quite healthy and fit with no risk factors. 


* April 28: Woke up tired and feeling “off” with a slightly sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in my neck. I coughed every now and then but nothing serious. In the evening, I suddenly got *extremely* fatigued – it was difficult to stand up without support. At the same time, I developed severe muscle and joint pain. It was the worst in my lower back and legs. It was weird how rapid the onset was. The pain became so bad that I couldn’t sleep for hours and I also had the chills. I just couldn’t get warm.

* April 29: Woke up with the same pain and the feeling that something was wrong. I had a dull headache and this weird pain behind my eyes. I could only look straight ahead; if I moved my eyes in any other direction it was extremely painful. I continued to feel like garbage throughout the day. Then during supper, I suddenly felt quite feverish and when I checked my temperature was 38.6 C/102 F. I called the COVID hotline to see if I could get tested, they said they’d get back to me. My condition kept getting worse from there; the fever, fatigue, and muscle/joint pain was unbearable. I went to lie down and I was unable to even get up to brush my teeth - it literally took me an hour to work up the strength to get back up and I had to hold on to the walls. After that it was basically a blur; I was in and out of sleep in a state of delirium, literally sopping wet with sweat. I’ve never produced that volume of sweat before. Just horrific. 

* April 30: Woke up at 5 AM feeling like I’d been hit by a truck, I couldn’t get up to use the bathroom because it took too much effort. Small movements felt insurmountable. I was unable to smell temporarily despite having no congestion. Very weird sensation – luckily my smell came back shortly after. I woke up again at 7 still with a raging fever and with severe pain in my eyes, muscles, and joints - especially my back. I took a Tylenol at 7 and by 8 my symptoms had improved. I could get up fairly easily and my temperature was just below 38 C/100 F. I legitimately thought I was in the clear until the Tylenol wore off 4 hours later. All of my symptoms came back at the same time. This time the Tylenol couldn’t keep the fever down and it stayed at 39 C/102 F for the rest of the day. The room was warm and my skin was burning but I was still freezing. Truly unpleasant. I had another night like the previous night; in and out of sleep and waking up soaked in sweat. I could only sleep about 4 hours.

* May 1: I’d woken up and taken a Tylenol in the night so I felt ok when I woke up. As soon as the meds wore off the symptoms came back. My fever stayed between 39-40 C/102-104 F all day. The Tylenol would take it down for a couple of hours but it would come right back up. During the time when it was highest I felt like I was dying; just completely unable to function. I also experienced some shortness of breath and chest tightness and just extreme fatigue. It was just a really tough day. I had a phone appointment with a doctor and I was diagnosed as officially positive - she’s certain I have it based on my symptoms. I was told to pay closest attention to the shortness of breath and chest pain and seek medical attention if they get worse. My throat was pretty sore and I started coughing more than before but still nothing serious. 

* May 2: Woke up every hour last night in pain and sweating. Temperature was 39.5 C/103 F at 5 AM so I took a Tylenol and it helped significantly. I developed a weird sharp pain in my upper thigh that hurts a lot when I walk. Otherwise, today I’m able to move around more comfortably and the symptoms aren’t as severe. It could be because I’m taking Tylenol at regular intervals before things have a chance to get bad. My brain is also extremely foggy today and I feel a little dizzy and lightheaded.The eye pain and dull headache is still present - I can still only look straight ahead. The lack of sleep is also getting to me but it’s impossible to sleep properly with such discomfort. 

Overall, I’m very stressed about this diagnosis. I’ve taken the stay at home orders very seriously and I’ve been extremely cautious - I have not set foot in public in over 6 weeks so I really cannot believe I got it. I did not think this was a possibility because I've been so careful. My family members recently went to a grocery store that we later learned had confirmed positive employees so we’re guessing I caught it from them or from something they brought into the house like groceries or a package. Weirdly enough no one else in the house has symptoms, so either they’re positive and asymptomatic or they’ll get sick soon too. Very stressful. 

Taking Tylenol every 4 hours seems to be the key to keeping symptoms at bay so I’ll keep doing this and hope for the best. I really regret reading so many articles about people suddenly dying of strokes or young people without pre-existing conditions dying. What a nightmare. I hope everyone else is coping ok and that you all start feeling better as soon as possible. This virus sucks. 

A list of my symptoms:

* Severe muscle and joint pain, mostly in back, legs, feet, neck

* Intense pain behind eyes, can’t look up, down or to the side. Also burning eyes/feeling of pressure

,COVID19positive,"I have POTS and other general “autonomic dysfunction issues” and I’ve been worried that this might actually be a risk factor for COVID-19. Everywhere I’ve looked before now has basically said something along the lines of “we don’t think dysautonomias are a risk factor but there’s not enough data to say they are not, so be careful.”

At first I wasn’t too concerned because the illness appeared to be mostly respiratory focused. But I’m seeing more and more news and research come out about covid-19 possibly attacking the nervous system in some patients and causing symptoms I already chronically struggle with, so now I’m worried that already having nervous system dysfunction will be potentially problematic if I were to catch it. And I’m an essential worker (grocery store) so I’m risking exposure every day.

So I’m wondering if anyone with previously diagnosed dysautonomia has tested or been presumed positive for covid-19, and if so what sort of symptoms did you have? Did you experience more of the neurological symptoms like loss of taste/smell, headaches, increased heart rate, shakes with no fever, slowed cognitive function, brain fogginess/confused behavior, etc.?

,COVID19positive,"(35F now on Day 56) My timeline goes something like this:

February 28-29: Probable exposure to virus on a long train ride and visit to the airport.

March 4: Began self-isolating due to early recommendations for at-risk population.  (I'm asthmatic and I have antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which is an autoimmune disorder that causes blood clots.)

March 7: First started feeling a rattling in my right lung. Lung felt congested but cough was unproductive. Some wheezing, but didn't feel like an asthma attack. Also experienced shortness of breath, headaches, muscle aches (chest and neck), fatigue (difficulty sitting up and staying awake), and nausea (did not throw up). Symptoms continued and gradually worsened for over ten days. Never developed a fever, as far as I can tell. Treated symptoms with Mucinex, Albuterol nebulizer, Zinc, Vitamins C &amp; D, and continued my usual daily doses of Advair, Singulair, Plavix, and Zyrtec. Also performed deep breathing exercises. Husband assisted with postural drainage and chest percussion.

March 18: Doctor prescribed 3-day course of Azithromycin for presumed bronchitis after a telemedicine appointment. Lungs began to improve over the following week (no more rattling) but shortness of breath and aching around the lungs (probably muscle strain from labored breathing) continued.

March 23: Took COVID-19 nasal test at a drive-thru facility.

March 31: Test results returned negative for SARS-CoV-2, presumably because it took so long for me to get a test that I was recovered by then. Symptoms faded in the following weeks, with slight lingering cough.

April 26: Developed a skin rash. Thought it was allergies and took Benadryl. Noticed a slight tickle in right lung.

April 27: Noticed right lung felt congested and was rattling again. Cough remained unproductive. Breathing not as labored as it was last month but worsening over two days. Blood oxygen range between 89-99.

April 29: Visited respiratory care clinic for physical examination. Doctor did not hear any crackling in my lungs but ordered COVID antibody test and chest x-ray.

May 1: Antibody test returned negative for SARS-CoV-2 Antibody IgG and positive for SARS-CoV-2 Antibody IgM. Doctor believes this means I have an active infection and should remain isolated. (I have been isolated since March 4.)

I have been unable to find a facility willing to perform a chest x-ray on a COVID patient. I was turned away at the hospital my doctor recommended. The staff at the main entrance told my husband to take me to the ER, ER told him they do not perform chest x-rays there and that I should not be admitted, staff at main entrance became hostile when my husband reported this to them and they called security over before I flagged him back to the car where I was waiting. When I called ahead to another facility, they said they're not performing chest x-rays on anyone right now.

I am awaiting further instructions from my doctor, but in the meantime, I'm feeling pretty confused and hopeless. I don't understand why I'm having a flare-up after doing so well for so long. Even now, I'll be doing alright for a few hours then suddenly worsen, back and forth. I'm having some weird muscle twitches and I can't tell if those are related or not. I don't know where to go for a chest x-ray without being admitted to the hospital (I'm in Los Angeles, by the way), especially since we're in the weekend now and nothing's open.

&lt;p&gt;March 23: Took COVID-19 nasal test at a drive-thru facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 31: Test results returned negative for SARS-CoV-2, presumably because it took so long for me to get a test that I was recovered by then. Symptoms faded in the following weeks, with slight lingering cough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 26: Developed a skin rash. Thought it was allergies and took Benadryl. Noticed a slight tickle in right lung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 27: Noticed right lung felt congested and was rattling again. Cough remained unproductive. Breathing not as labored as it was last month but worsening over two days. Blood oxygen range between 89-99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 29: Visited respiratory care clinic for physical examination. Doctor did not hear any crackling in my lungs but ordered COVID antibody test and chest x-ray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 1: Antibody test returned negative for SARS-CoV-2 Antibody IgG and positive for SARS-CoV-2 Antibody IgM. Doctor believes this means I have an active infection and should remain isolated. (I have been isolated since March 4.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been unable to find a facility willing to perform a chest x-ray on a COVID patient. I was turned away at the hospital my doctor recommended. The staff at the main entrance told my husband to take me to the ER, ER told him they do not perform chest x-rays there and that I should not be admitted, staff at main entrance became hostile when my husband reported this to them and they called security over before I flagged him back to the car where I was waiting. When I called ahead to another facility, they said they&amp;#39;re not performing chest x-rays on anyone right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am awaiting further instructions from my doctor, but in the meantime, I&amp;#39;m feeling pretty confused and hopeless. I don&amp;#39;t understand why I&amp;#39;m having a flare-up after doing so well for so long. Even now, I&amp;#39;ll be doing alright for a few hours then suddenly worsen, back and forth. I&amp;#39;m having some weird muscle twitches and I can&amp;#39;t tell if those are related or not. I don&amp;#39;t know where to go for a chest x-ray without being admitted to the hospital (I&amp;#39;m in Los Angeles, by the way), especially since we&amp;#39;re in the weekend now and nothing&amp;#39;s open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is any of this familiar to anyone? Is it just going to keep getting worse?&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive," 

First of all, I'm not a native English Speaker, so forgive me with the grammar.

26  Male without a big health issue. No smoke. No Drugs. No overweight.  However, I live in Mexico where the majority of our public health system  is trash, so I don't like the idea of being hospitalized if it is  necessary. Presumptive positive do the fact that I have a lot of contact with a positive case of Covid like one week ago.

I  guess that I caught the Covid19 and I would like to read your  experiences. This bad feeling started recently, but I had never  experienced something like this.

Since  Tuesday I started to feel an annoyingly thrust in the middle of my  chest, but no consistency. No fever. No cough. I thought it was for some  food that I ate. At this time I didn't know that the person that have covid was positive.

On  Wednesday I woke up normally, but at midday suddenly I felt tired, but  really really tired. I had to take a lemon tea with a lot of honey to  gain energy. After that I started feeling really bad in general, like a  zombie, but I'm aware that my anxiety had a big part of that. I also  felt a tilting sensation in my upper back and my forearms went numb. In  the same way, again the burning chest sensation appeared but more  strong. In despite of, I didn't have any problems with my breathing  rate, in fact, a big breathing alleviated the pain. To try to calm down  my symptonms and fight to whatever it was, I did a season of Wim Hof's  Method and took a cold shower. It really helps me a lot. Btw this day I knew that I have been exposed with a person with covid19.

Before  to sleep, my unique and constant symptom was a sensation of burning  chest. Symptom than today I 'discovered' that  I can mitigate  if I took  a lemon tea with garlic and onion. Despite of this, I'm really scared  that this could be a critical symptom (pain in the middle of the chest)  and that in the next days of weeks all will be worse, since the chest (I  guess) is a risk zone for the covid19.

But  the oddity continues. On Thursday I woke up like a healthy child. I  rested very well and for the first 6 hours of the day I felt great.  Unfortunately, at 1 pm I started feeling the burning chest again and my  joints too warm. I don't have pain in my joints,  but I guess this is a  bad sign of the coming. And again, no fever, no coughs, no problems in  general with my breathing.

For  now, I only feel the tightness in my chest and I don't know what to  think. I mean, I did my research and I found that the cough and fever  are a mechanism of our inmmune system to tackle down the diseases so, If  I started with a pain in the chest in this journey and my body isn't  doing anything, how then I will overcome the illness?

Today, I only have a little pain in my upper back so I guess that the fight is on my lungs but again, no fever, no cough. I dont know if the virus sneaked my immune system.

If  anyone had the burning chest or upper back pain experiences at the beginning of the Covid,  please share with my your journey. It will help me a lot.

Btw this day I knew that I have been exposed with a person with covid19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before  to sleep, my unique and constant symptom was a sensation of burning  chest. Symptom than today I &amp;#39;discovered&amp;#39; that  I can mitigate  if I took  a lemon tea with garlic and onion. Despite of this, I&amp;#39;m really scared  that this could be a critical symptom (pain in the middle of the chest)  and that in the next days of weeks all will be worse, since the chest (I  guess) is a risk zone for the covid19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But  the oddity continues. On Thursday I woke up like a healthy child. I  rested very well and for the first 6 hours of the day I felt great.  Unfortunately, at 1 pm I started feeling the burning chest again and my  joints too warm. I don&amp;#39;t have pain in my joints,  but I guess this is a  bad sign of the coming. And again, no fever, no coughs, no problems in  general with my breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For  now, I only feel the tightness in my chest and I don&amp;#39;t know what to  think. I mean, I did my research and I found that the cough and fever  are a mechanism of our inmmune system to tackle down the diseases so, If  I started with a pain in the chest in this journey and my body isn&amp;#39;t  doing anything, how then I will overcome the illness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I only have a little pain in my upper back so I guess that the fight is on my lungs but again, no fever, no cough. I dont know if the virus sneaked my immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If  anyone had the burning chest or upper back pain experiences at the beginning of the Covid,  please share with my your journey. It will help me a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"About three days ago i slept a ridiculous amount (like 16 hours) inexplicably. That day I started getting a fever. Chills, alternating with sweats, and body aches, mostly in my lower back. The fever gets way worse at night and makes it almost impossible to sleep, even after taking tylenol. I have been waking up in the morning in a pool of sweat. The fever has been pretty persistent. Although, around late evening it almost vanishes, but it comes back with a vengeance at night. Now on day three i have a very mild cough. So mild that if it were just the cough i’d think nothing of it, and it’s accompanied by a scratchy throat on/off.

,COVID19positive,"My fiance started to feel sick April 23rd. Initial symptoms were sinus congestion, achiness, skin sensitivity, headache, low grade fever.

,COVID19positive,"33F, nonsmoker, very light/social drinker, daily cannabis user (strictly edibles). I'm in mostly good health though could definitely stand to lose a few pounds. I do 3-4 cardio (indoor cycling and walking outdoors/hiking) and lifting sessions a week.

Day 1, Saturday April 18: Woke up with a slight headache, headache continued throughout the day. The headache almost felt like I'd been holding tension in my neck/jaw all day, towards the back of my skull. Slight tickle in my throat and by 6pm deep breaths slightly uncomfortable but not unmanageable. No medication. 

Day 2, Sunday April 19th: Slept well, woke up a bit hot but no temperature. Sounds like I'm losing my voice but a hot shower helped. Took 2 Tylenol at 8:30am for headache. Throughout the day I needed to clear my throat about every 10 minutes. Slept from 10am-1pm. Took another two Tylenol at 5pm for headache and muscle soreness. Lymph nodes possibly slightly swollen. Before bed around 10:15pm I took 2 Tylenol and 10ml DM.

Day 3, Monday April 20th: Bad night of sleep, maybe slept from 1:30am-5am. Woke up with  headache, mostly a dull ache behind my eyes. Took temperature at 12:30pm, 99.9. At 1:30pm took 2 Tylenol and 10ml DM. 9:15pm took 2 Tylenol, 10ml DM, 10mg Indica - no symptoms but needed to sleep well.

Day 4, Tuesday April 21st: Slept about 6 hours. Still feel like I'm about to get sick - keep clearing my throat. Tongue feels like it was burned. More coughing in the morning than usual but nothing concerning. No chest tightness, no congestion. Left shoulder blade sore but that's not atypical for me. Had to drive to get tested and almost felt impaired. Got home and had some disorientation and confusion.  Boss told me to take the day off. Took CBD/THC tincture are 10:30am. Around 11:30am took 10mg Hybrid and slept on and off from noon until 5pm. Started to make dinner at 6pm exhausted by very little activity. Have to sit down every few minutes, not shortness of breath but feels like I'm just not pulling in enough oxygen. By 6:30pm I let work know I wouldn't be in for the whole week. 2 Tylenol at 6:30pm, developed low grade fever. Sense of taste and smell seems to be unaffected in the evening. 7:45pm took 10ml DM. Did breathing exercises and sleep meditation for around 15 minutes before falling asleep. 5mg Indica for sleep.

Day 5, Wednesday April 22nd: Woke up feeling very tired, weak and with lots of brain fog. Went back to sleep until 10:30am. Phone call confirmation of positive result. Sitting up and reading/browsing is exhausting. Took a shower at 11am, slightly short of breath. Can't taste or smell anything. Slept again 3pm-6:30pm. Dinner of cold cure broth. Tylenol at 7:30pm for severe muscle and joint aches. Waves of intense nausea that dissipate just as quickly as they came on. At 10:30pm 5mg Indica. 

Day 6, Thursday April 23rd: Woke up feeling downright normal. Slept all through the night until 7am. Decided to try and get up and cook breakfast - made 2 scrambled eggs and coffee, by the time I finished one egg I was mid-chewing the second and was like, too tired to swallow. It was insane. Spit it out and went back to bed, slept from 8-12:30pm.  Around 7 felt like I developed a fever but checked and it’s 98.6. Took two Tylenol got chills and possible developing fever. Terrible night of sleep, insomnia and chills. Stomach was growling before I fell asleep but too difficult to get up.

Day 7, Friday April 24th: Bad night of sleep, took 2 Tylenol at 3am for chills. Fell back asleep around 5am, woke up at 9:30am. Took 2 Tylenol for chills. Took a shower and had some cold cure broth, felt a lot better and got laundry and dishes done as well as took meals out of freezer to thaw. Felt sick/chills/fever around 3 so slept from 3-6. Felt a little better after eating and Tylenol. At 8:30 felt good enough to bake bread, do dishes, thaw soup from freezer. For sleep and cough: 5mg Indica, Nyquil

Day 8, Saturday April 25th: Slept 11 hours. Woke up feeling exhausted but had to sit up. Fell back asleep until 1pm. Slight headache all day that Tylenol didn't touch. 

Day 9, Sunday April 26th: Slept 12 hours, mostly stayed in bed all day. Body aches more intense and developed productive cough. No fever, chills. No appetite. Severe IT band and hip pain. 5mg Indica and Nyquil for cough.

Day 10, Monday April 27th: Slept 8 hours, no symptoms.

,COVID19positive,"Hi. I have no idea if I had COVID19 because I was not tested. I live in NYC and on March 18th got super cold, heavy sweating, nauseous, dizzy, tingling sensations in lips and extremities, body shakes, tight chest pains.. had to wrap myself in multiple layers and lay down in front of a space heater... going through waves of intensity all night long.. then woke up the next day feeling better (not great) - within 2 days felt good and within 5 days or so my chest felt better again.

Flash forward to last night (April 30th) after over 6 weeks from my first experience - 6 weeks of feeling fine/good health - I started to get super cold again, head tingling, lips went numb/tingled.. weird feelings of loss of breathe/tightening of chest... I repeated what I did last time - multiple layers to keep warm and a space heater turned on high.. - WITHIN 45 mins it was all over.. very weird.. but felt off all day today too.. cold/hot .. a bit of random sweating.. but nothing major..

,COVID19positive,"I am a 26 year old female in Minneapolis. Last month I was really sick and was presumed positive but due to lack of tests I was unable to get one. My symptoms were milder than a lot of descriptions so I wanted to see if anyone had a similar experience. 

Day 1-3: nausea, general upset stomach, feeling unwell 

Day 3: terrible pounding headache 

Day 4: terrible headache, body aches all over 

Day 5: The cough started. It was dry and my chest started hurting a lot when I coughed and breathed. I tried taking cough syrup but it didn’t really help

Day 6-10: kind of a blur, more coughing, extreme fatigue (walking from the couch to my bed would wipe me out), I slept as much as I could between the coughing. Body aches were persistent but nothing absolutely terrible. I felt feverish but my temp never registered above 99.8. Absolutely zero appetite. Whenever I stood up I got pretty dizzy. 

Day 11-14: more fatigue and dizziness, cough slowly started getting better. 

Now: coughing sometimes, nothing major. 

I never lost taste or smell, I also suffer from seasonal allergies but this was not my typical “allergy cold”, I had no post nasal drip.

,COVID19positive,"Hello! I just want to get some reassurance if I should start looking for a plan B on several plans that actually were going to start this month.

I’m working from home since 2 months ago so I haven’t been going out as frequent as usual. I just leave my house to go to the store and do shopping or receive a delivery arriving to my house.

About around Monday I noticed like a “rash” on my leg, it didn’t hurt or was itchy, I just noticed that it was really red. I got a little bit concerned since I’m pretty allergic and it was completely different from the rashes I have had all my life.

That rash started turning purple and bigger, so on Wednesday my dad said that he was going to take me the next day to the hospital so I could get that rash checked and treated, and it was going to be fine.

I started Thursday as normal as usual but a terrible headache started, then earache and when I noticed I had 39 degrees of fever and a pretty sore throat. I was getting some paracetamol for the fever and my pains and I managed myself to finish my shift.

As soon as my shift was over, my mom run with me to the hospital. I explained that I had a weird rash which was my main reason of getting there. The nurse took my signs and I was at that moment over 38 degrees of fever but I could get down 39.

The nurse told me to wait outside for a doctor to call me, then a couple of minutes later she called me inside again and I was guided to like a “secret area” in where everyone was wearing lots of personal protection gear. 

A doctor came and she explained that she was going to check on me to know if I needed to get the Covid-19 test or if she had to send me antibiotics. She examined me and my ears and throat didn’t show any sign of a bacterial infection. So I got some blood tests to discard a bacterial infection and it actually happened!! So the doctor said that she wasn’t going to send me antibiotics and we proceed with taking the sample for my Covid-19 test.

I had to wait and I got some injections for my pain, the pharmacy prepared my medicines (basically more paracetamol) to take home and I was told that I had to be completely isolated in my room until today when the results should be ready.

Around 3pm at the time I was told that my results will be ready, I called the hospital to know if they were ready and to confirm my email address for getting the results and sending everything to my insurance. And I was told then that my results will be ready until SATURDAY in the afternoon.

I’m not worried at all about being sick, what worries me is that I need to know if I should consider other things, but my biggest worry is that I am supposed to start Uni in 1 week and classes will be online meanwhile, government let my university give classes inside their building. But if I’m infected then I will have to consider another university and 100% virtual classes to don’t expose anyone of getting infected too.

As of this week, I've been having horrible headaches that consisted of pain behind my eyes and all over the head (started on Tuesday), a somewhat low-grade fever (ranges from 99-99.6 throughout the day), a bit of a lack of appetite (due to anxiety, presumed), high heart rate (100-110, my blood pressure is normal though), and a little bit of chest pain. I have had no coughing symptoms nor shortness of breath.

I went to the doctor since I didn't feel right and he ordered a panel for everything and my Potassium came back a bit low (It was about 3.4), but everything came back normal and there was no sign of infection. He ordered a potassium supplement for me to take for the next 10 days and will test me again after that. Should I suspect this is COVID?

,COVID19positive,"Hi (M, 28 Years Old) I just wanted to share my story to see if anyone else is in a similar boat. So I had my first symptoms of Coronavirus after waking up March 15 (low fever, chills/ aches, slight soar throat). I realized I was exposed to a positive case so right off the bat I was sure...

For the first week or so, it was really bad and I barely wanted to get out of bed. Around the second to third week, I started to ""feel better"" but the shortness of breath began. This was the scariest part and led me to be able to get tested for the first time (I called my doctor multiple times trying to get tested before but I wasn't allowed until this point. Literally they'd say just stay at home and basically unless you're dying don't come to hospital). I tested officially positive on March 26th after going to a local Urgent Care in Los Angeles that had tests. 

I describe my experience as coming and going in ""waves."" One morning I could feel amazing and then at night my symptoms would get worse and so on. No day was really the same!

So, I finally got retested April 22nd and I'm still positive!!!

I feel for like for the last two weeks I've been ""mostly good"" but even now I'll still get weird headaches, achey feelings in my body and breathing difficulty that will spring out of no where.

I'm hoping to get a confirmation for a negative test next week or the week after but I'm not optimistic...This is giving me a lot of anxiety and I feel like I'm one of those people it's going to linger in for months. I'm scared about the long term implications....I keep hearing about all these things about longer term damage.

I just need to vent out my anxiety and I wanted to see if anyone is going through something similar! If you are know or going through a long term case let me know!

,COVID19positive,"Hi all, my grandmother tested positive in late March. Don't think anyone would be able to help, but would love to know if anyone has seen or heard of this happening.

In the first few weeks, she had a fever and a cough. A few weeks later when she no longer had a fever, her mood changed and she refused to eat or do anything. She seemed very irritated all the time. So for about 1 1/2 - 2 weeks after her fever stopped, she became very weak due to a lack of movement and nutrients. Throughout this time, her oxygen level remained at about the mid 80's. But she never complained about any breathing problems. We eventually got her in home oxygen treatment and a nurse to look at her once a week through hospice care. The nurse said that her lungs sound good and that there is very little fluids in her lungs. My grandmother is usually a very outgoing person but during this time, she was extremely weak and seemed to be unable to talk much too.

Eventually, she slowly began to eat a bit more (nutrients in liquid form) and with the oxygen treatment, she's been above 95 for the most part and her blood pressure and heart rate has been very good. She's made dramatic improvements five weeks since testing positive. She's talking again, eating normal foods again and has been in a good mood. She's almost able to walk on her own too. But one of my main concerns now is that now that she's talking, she seems to have short term memory loss. She has no recollection of anything that has happened even a few hours ago. Every morning we see her, she'd say that she hasn't seen us in a long time. It's basically like a 50 First Dates situation. She does remember things that have happened in her life from a long time ago and things even a few months ago, just nothing recent.

This is really weird because she is usually really smart and has not shown any memory problems in the past. We're thinking it's possible she could have this because she usually takes a lot of medications, but we don't know what she takes usually, we just give her the more important medications like blood pressure and blood sugar. Maybe, not being on something or mixing some things could cause this? Her doctor knows all of this but he is not being helpful at all right now because he said that she's not his responsibility and that she is currently under hospice care so he can't help. And hospice care said that we should consult her doctor about this memory loss issue. It's been quite frustrating. Maybe it was a due to the lack of oxygen for a week or so? Or could it be because she has laid in bed for about a month, not able to move, not keeping track of the time/day, not doing anything but just having random thoughts.

No matter who you are and what you're going through, you can beat this.

,COVID19positive,"First, I want to say I was tested on March 14 (feels like 84 years ago) after showcasing mild symptoms for about 3-4 days at that point. I was around someone who had been on a cruise, so that’s why they tested me. I tested negative, but my doctor and I agree I likely have it and just tested too early in the intubation period. 

I literally wasn’t worried when I first thought I had it because I kept seeing “2 weeks to recover” everywhere and thought oh, this’ll be over in 2 weeks. Was I ever wrong. 

It’s been 1.5 months and my symptoms have still lingered. I honestly don’t even believe the good days I have anymore because I know the next day the symptoms will be back. 

The weird thing is I never really got “sick.” Like when you think of someone out with the flu or cold, I haven’t been like that at all. I haven’t slipped into a fever at all this whole time. I’ve had hay fever/allergic episodes in the past that have had me out worse.

These are the symptoms I have been having and I’m hoping someone here can relate or tell me they’re experiencing this too because I’m frikin going insane. I’m sick, but not. Ya know? 

I’ve had: 

- a sporadic dry cough. It was definitely suppressible and I would never go into hacking fits or anything. The cough is all but gone now, but there’s a lingering urge to clear my throat. 

- Heaviness in my chest, worse when I was lying down. It almost felt like my chest is caving in sometimes. 

- labored breathing. STILL have this. It’s hard to say if it’s getting worse or better because it’s been so up and down. And like I said, I never really peaked (I hate this word) with a single worst day, so it’s hard to tell if it’s getting better. It’s not getting worse. So there’s that. 

- everything is SO dry. Everything from my nasal cavities to my airways just feels like there is absolutely zero moisture. I can hear and feel the air going down my nasal cavity and/or throat. It also makes this whoosh/wheez sound like there’s too much friction and not enough moisture. If that make sense.  

- this breathlessness feel to everything. I don’t know how else to explain it. Like it doesn’t feel like the air I’m breathing in is getting as much O2 in me. 

- I have to take this deep breath every few minutes just to fill my lungs with good oxygen. 

- barely any mucus or phlegm at all. But my nose still feels stuffed with pressure, which makes it hard to smell. (Idk if this is the loss of smell they’re talking about, but I can still smell if I put the thing up closer to my nose). 

- diarrhea the first few days, that has gone away. 

- terrible acid reflux/heart burn that was awful the first couple of weeks but kind of comes and goes now. 

- upper back pain, neck pain and pretty bad stiffness.  Shoulder blade area is achy. This has actually gotten worse the past week. I looked this symptom up and it said lung cancer and now I’m not going to look anything else up anymore. 

- heart palpitations at the most random time. I’ll simply turn over in bed and my heart will just start pounding so loud...it honestly feels louder and slower, but it might be louder and quicker can’t tell. Couple of times my heart actually skipped a beat. 

- wheezing. I think most of that noise is when I’m breathing in through my nose and I can feel that noise in my nose, but there’s definitely some wheezing from mouth breathing too (which tells me it’s coming from my lungs). 

Honestly I just feel like I’m going crazy at this point. I never really “fell ill.” It’s like, am I or am I not sick? How much of this is anxiety? Some may consider my case a “mild,” but it’s going on two months now and I’m losing sight of the light at the end of the tunnel. I’m worried about permanent damage now and that’s not helping. I miss when I wouldn’t give a second thought to breathing. Now I’m monitoring everything about my breathing. And the getting better and then back to how it was and then better with no rhyme or reason? I can’t deal with that for much longer. I feel like I’m getting gaslit.

Also I can&amp;#39;t wait to get back to running since running for me helps anxiety and stress, and it&amp;#39;s the worst period of the year to not be able to relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read in many places that this is related to inflammation. I was wondering are there any studies of ibuprofen during recovery? I&amp;#39;ve heard that it&amp;#39;s bad to take when you have COVID, but if I have post viral inflammation, could it help? Has anyone taken ibuprofen during recovery?&lt;/p&gt;

Before getting sick, my wife felt symptoms 10 days prior and tested positive. She then quarantined herself so I assume the incubation period for me was 10 days (though it is technically possible I caught it after she quarantined).

April 1: first day of symptoms as I felt a sudden onset of chills and that ""malaise"" feeling

April 2: had a fever at night of around 100 but Tylenol took care of it.

April 3: actually started to feel better with mild symptoms

April 4: weird throat sensation (as if there was hair in my mouth) and lost sense of taste/smell

April 7-10: suddenly felt ill again, definitely worse than the onset.  Fever, chills, fatigue, GI issues, body aches but no cough and very mild respiratory issues.

April 11-17: started to feel a bit better but still with the malaise.  I did feel I was able to work though not 100%.

April 18-24: started feeling noticeably better but still quite fatigued and a few ""bad"" days/waves mixed in. Started getting sense of taste/smell back.

April 25-27: felt noticeably worse again, body aches, fatigue but not as sick as prior. At this point I was quite frustrated that I was unable to shake this thing as it was almost 4 weeks.

April 28-30 (today): noticeably improved and only symptom is the weird feeling in my throat.  Much less fatigue too.  Hopefully I am on the mend but the waves can come out of nowhere!

,COVID19positive,"Everyone knows that covid symptoms are extremely sudden.  They vanish and appear within seconds.  

I have recorded the duration of two of my bouts of fever.  The definition of ""fever"" was any temperature sustained above 98.6 F.  It is somewhat unscientific because I only started recording after feeling subjectively hot.  But the thermostat and bedroom is the same, left on the same temp throughout the day, so it is still ""pretty"" controlled for a home experiment.  

One of these fevers lasted 16 minutes, the other 25 minutes.  I've been sick for 7 weeks, and I can almost guarantee that the fevers I had prior to this were a bit longer.  

Anyway, on the 16 minute fever I reached a peak temp of 98.9 F.  On the 25 minute one I reached 99.1.  

I had similar results in previous covid fevers, though I didn't record the duration.  I remember temperatures of 99 - 99.8 F.  Still, like I said, these fevers were definitely longer, by a lot.

One thing that stands out to me is that **peak temp correlates with fever duration.**  This is completely expected, because the longer your body generates heat for, the hotter you will get, until you reach an equilibrium steady-state temperature.  Which brings us to the second point, which is that **low temperatures are due to the transient sudden nature of covid fevers.**  I remember what flu fevers feel like, and they are nowhere near as sudden, which is probably why they regularly go above 100 F.  Yet many people (including myself) cannot, or can only barely, break 100 F.

&lt;p&gt;One thing that stands out to me is that &lt;strong&gt;peak temp correlates with fever duration.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is completely expected, because the longer your body generates heat for, the hotter you will get, until you reach an equilibrium steady-state temperature.  Which brings us to the second point, which is that &lt;strong&gt;low temperatures are due to the transient sudden nature of covid fevers.&lt;/strong&gt;  I remember what flu fevers feel like, and they are nowhere near as sudden, which is probably why they regularly go above 100 F.  Yet many people (including myself) cannot, or can only barely, break 100 F.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that your body doesn&amp;#39;t run a fever for long enough to actually reach steady state--that&amp;#39;s why there are so many people with 99 F fevers.&lt;/p&gt;

**The strange thing is that from the beginning I have had high blood pressure typically above 140/80**. Systolic is always high, and diastolic fluctuates from normal to high. I find this odd as most people have reported low blood pressure more akin to heart failure.  My resting pulse is always normal too 45-65 (yes, as an athlete resting heart rate in the mid 40s is normal for me.)

I have always had normal blood pressure, even as early as one month before this all began. 

Is anybody else experiencing sustained high blood pressure throughout their illness?

,COVID19positive,"Hi all,

About 40 days ago, our entire household got sick with something that we didn't think was COVID 19, because there was only a handful of cases in our very very large, very empty state at the time. For me, it was mild symptoms with a slight cough, and no fever (similar symptoms with everyone else in the household). A few days after my symptoms went away, I had a complete loss of smell and taste, and that prompted the household member with the best insurance to get tested. She got tested positive April 8. We received calls from the health department etc... Since then we've been quarantining very strictly, and I am currently at home all the time with very little to no exposure. I was, however, completely symptom free by April 15.

Today, I ended up waking up with a sore throat and a feeling of fever, although my thermometer said my body temp was only around 37.8 °C. I am getting by with taking Tylenol etc. I am going to get tested tomorrow. 

I know people had symptoms going away, and symptoms coming back a few days later, but my question is: Has anybody had their symptoms subside for almost 2 weeks before they came back just as bad as the first time they got it? Or is this just some other cold I've been unlucky enough to catch? Any information to help with with the anxiety would be appreciated.

&lt;p&gt;I know people had symptoms going away, and symptoms coming back a few days later, but my question is: Has anybody had their symptoms subside for almost 2 weeks before they came back just as bad as the first time they got it? Or is this just some other cold I&amp;#39;ve been unlucky enough to catch? Any information to help with with the anxiety would be appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

Also just as a long shot gonna include the post I'm attempting to make below here too incase anyone who's reading this knows any the answers

My father is 73 and high risk if he were to catch coronavirus. I'm trying to keep him as safe as I can especially as it's been getting pretty bad in our area. I've been looking into a few products from an online pharmacy and have emailed them but it says 3-5 days for a reply so was hoping someone here could help me quicker. Apologise I know my writings a bit all over the place but I suffer from pretty bad anxiety which has been all over the place since all this starting but to anyone who takes the time to read it and help, it's truly hugely appreciated, thank you. 

This is the email I sent to the pharmacy 

Okay so sorry this is a bit of a long email but I've been really concerned about my father during this whole thing as he's 73 years old and high risk as well for other reasons. I was looking at some of your products and trying to decide what's best to do for him. I see the FFP2 / N95 Face Mask for a tenner then I also see you have another one, the FFP3/N99 Face Mask for 20 quid. This mask from what I can read appears to definetly be better however its only 1 mask for £20. Is this mask designed to be used more than once? And if so how many times could you use this mask before it needing to be replaced? He only goes out every about 2 weeks to get his shopping, which is done early in the morning while Iceland has the first hour dedicated to the elderly. Which takes hin probably about 1 hour that he would be wearing the mask from the time that he leaves his house to the time that he gets back.


Now I was looking at other products you stocked as well to try to make this as safe as possible for him. I see you carry SurSol Hand Sanitiser which says in its description it stays active for up to 4 hours on skin. So my thought process for this was that if he washed his hands with it before going to do his shopping then this would essentially mean if he touches something (say the food he's buying for example) that if someone else had touched it and was now contaninated with coronavirus. Because of him having the SurSol Hand Sanatizer still active on his hands then that would kill it. So then there wouldn't be a worry that he would be bringing items into his house that had coronavirus on them but to even play it extra safe then he could use the SurSol Anti-Virus Disinfectant Surface Cleaner to spray his shopping and wipe it down when he gets home which should hopefully completely eliminate his chance of getting it. 


Now my other extra precautionary idea is that I buy all this for myself (and still get him this sort of stuff as well just in the off chance he ever did need to leave the house) and that I do his shopping and leave it for him out his front. The only reason I've not been doing his shopping for him so far is that it felt safer to me that he was being allowed to shop in the morning when the store is cleanest and its limited to just the elderly although recently they started opening other stores in the shopping centre so he has to go past them to get to Iceland. He says he can still keep more than 6 feet distance when he passes them but with his age and him being high risk it still worries me. At the same time tho if it was possible to still make it safe for him to get out and do his shopping this way it would be great as I worry about someone his age living alone being stuck inside for so long.


I apologize for such a long message and I know I probably sound a bit scatterbrained but my anxiety has just been through the roof worrying about him since this started. Thanks you for taking your time to read this and any help would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: Resolution, I spoke to him about the plan I wrote in the replys. I can't bring to allow me to do his shopping for him. I can understand this, mental health can be just as important as physical health so I can understand how much it could be stuck in the house all the time with no end in sight. But he agrees only to go out for his shopping and use that 4 hour hand sanatizer first and do his shopping while wearing a mask then when returning using the hand sanatizer again and then when he unpacks his stuff hell spray them with the anti virus spray that's made by the same brand as the hand sanatizer before he puts them away and then discard of the bags and spay the counter the bags were sat on with the anti virus spray... He didn't mention to now to me but he's been taking trips down to the local corner shop Sunday mornings as well but agreed to stop doing that and if he needs something from there then hell let me go in and get them for him in the way I planned to get his shopping.

,COVID19positive,"I guys spent I have been posting recently about my experience. Doctors seem worried for me and it’s stressing me out.

So today I had a follow up zoom video chat with a DR and she said I will most likely get results tomorrow. She has the vitals from yesterday and said my oxygen level is 88%. Which apparently is pretty low. Asked if I have any underlying heart conditions or anything. Obviously I am getting anxious! She also instructed me to go to ER and have oxygen/get lungs checked out if it gets worse. I’m so stressed :( how have you guys been dealing with the stress? Has anyone else had low oxygen levels.

26 healthy male, not at all overweight, quite sedentary, quit a smoking habit 6 months ago. Presumed positive, but not tested because tests were tight and I'm still a young lad. I have no history of (health) anxiety whatsoever, or any chronic illnesses.  

\---

18 March: mild muscle pains

19-24 March: muscle pain became more severe, often in different locations but mostly around the lower back and upper leg area. Slight fatigue and difficulty concentrating.

25 March: sudden onset of mild respiratory distress, which gradually grew more severe over the course of 6-ish hours to the point where it became difficult for me to speak. Called a doc, visited the ER. Presumed positive diagnosis. I felt completely drained and could barely move. 

26-31 March: The first days after visiting the ER were horrible. I slept 15 hours most days, and was barely awake for the others. No fever, no cough, but a myriad of GI symptoms. Complete lack of hunger. Difficulty breathing gradually started to subside after 28 April.  

1-8 April: Felt mostly recovered, but I still did not feel 100%. Breathing at least was no longer scary. I was still more fatigued and slept 11 hours a day most days. I had intermittent GI symptoms. 

8-14 April: No symptoms, but exercise (mild, e.g. sex) did result in breathlesness which persisted for an hour or so. 

15-18 April: Muscle pains return, exhaustion and GI symptoms, by the 18th I felt much better. 

19-23 April: All symptoms apart from breathing issues returned suddenly, including throat pain as a new symptom. By the 23rd I was basically recovered, but still had some lingering throat pain. 

24 April - 30 April (time of writing), symptom free. Even the fatigue has been completely absent, and i've been able to work, concentrate, and take 3-4km walks without remission or breathlesness.   

\---

My girlfriend who is also a healthy 26yo, with absolutely no history of smoking, is fighting another wave off now, and became symptomatic at the same time as me. She had a slightly more mild case, in the sense that her breathlesness never got as bad as mine. A week may be too early to say that I won't be facing another wave, but I consistantly have normal levels of energy, a healthy appetite, and can concentrate on my work. 

For a long while I was scared, lengthy illness is severely distressing emotionally, and at times I felt desperate. Nothing feels worse than waking up to another day of misery, or waking up fine but being faced with the disappointment of another miserable evening.

All in all I do feel better, but don’t quite feel 100% yet. Last night I felt very fatigued and had night sweats despite me recovering.  I’m scared if I go back to work I’ll relapse. I’ve been holed up in my room while my family just brings me food and water. Any thoughts and advice from you guys? I can’t work from home since I’m a health care worker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: Recovering, but still got a slight cough and don’t feel 100% yet. Work is pestering me to come back. Been out of work for 18 days already. Unsure of what to do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"On Sunday my husband woke up with a mild cough. He doesn't suffer from allergies usually and rarely gets sick so this was unusual. On Monday he woke up and the cough was worse. He managed to get tested that morning. The next day (Tuesday) he got the call that he was Negative.

That same day, I stated to feel really lethargic. I've been working out daily and have felt pretty great lately, so suddenly being so badly fatigued was strange. I slept probably 13 hours in total that day. I even fell asleep at 8pm which is very strange considering I have insomnia and am nearly always awake till at least 1am.

Wednesday, I noticed my baby girl (11 months) was really fussy. She's normally a laid back baby and we have a good routine down but she wasn't having any of it. I checked her temp and got readings from 100.2-101.4 (our thermometer is old and not the most accurate but I cross checked everybody else's temp in the house and we were all normal ranges.) I started getting a throbbing headache and I can't tell if it's due to over sleeping or not. 

It's now early Thursday morning, tylenol is no longer bringing my baby's fever down it seems and she's stuck in the 101 range. She feels like she's on fire when I touch her. She's fussier than usual, keeps waking up periodically, and is drinking her bottles just fine. I'm trying very hard to stay calm but this is her first time with a stubborn fever and it's making me very anxious. I still have a throbbing headache. No other symptoms for me, and my husband's cough seems to be almost gone. And my oldest child (6) hasn't shown any symptoms of anything at all.

It's a bit early for allergy season in my area, but I've had runny nose, aches and pains, and horrible throat pain. I'm pretty hopeful that it's just some type of strep, or bacterial thing, but also, I'm sick during a pandemic. Yeesh.

My throat and tonsils have visible white spots, that look almost like tonsil stones in the back of my throat. Havent had my tonsils removed.

Also cant find anyone confirming this specifically isnt a symptom.. I'd love to hear from some of you. Thank you so much, sending positive vibes.

First had symptoms on March 18.
Started out with aches and feeling tired.
Couple of days later aches were worse, stayed in bed, very flu like.
This carried on for a week, then the aches went but still felt tired, weak and started coughing.

9 days in most of it in bed, coughing, weak, worse at night. Then felt something bad had happened to my left lung, felt tight, wasn't breathing too well.
Phoned an ambulance.

Went to hospital, had an x-ray and a swab test for covid-19. Doctor and nurses said looking at my x-ray and symptoms it was very likely I had covid-19. Admitted to hospital for covid-19 and pnuemonia, was on a drip for 3 days, and oxygen mask for 5.
Discharged on the afternoon of the 5 day.

At home couldn't do very much at all.
Had continuous coughing fits when standing up or moving around, very breathless and weak stayed in bed.
Second day at home had a weird feeling in my right lower leg. Felt very tight, couldn't move it, sent back to hospital. I had DVT, sent home with medicine.

Gradually got better over the next two weeks. Less coughing, not as breathless, still couldn't stand or move for that long. But sitting in a chair rather than bed. Improving every day.

24 April sent to hospital for a chest x-ray
X-ray showed still quite a lot of stuff on my left lung, need to go back for another X-ray in 4 weeks, hopefully it will be clearer.

,COVID19positive,"Hello, I (23, F) want to share my experience. So I started becoming symptomatic on March 30th. I woke up very tired and with a low fever. I called out of work and went back to bed. I slept most of the day and developed a cough and shortness of breath. I called my doctor the next day and was sent for testing. The nasal swab was not inserted very far and was on par with a flu swab experience. I was perscribed an antibiotic. The test came back negative, but the doctor (from the test center, not primary care) told me based on my symptoms her presumes I am positive and to quarantine as such. He then perscribed an inhaler.
During my second week I still felt very fatigued. There were two days where I thought I was on the mend with less shortness of breath and less of a cough. Then I started feeling much worse. I felt much more short of breath and tightness in my chest. I follow up with my doctor (primary care) and she dismissed most of my symptoms and said since I was negative and am not in respiratory distress I should being feeling okay and put me on prednisone and symbicort to help with any inflammation that may be in my lungs. 
I took the prednisone and felt no different. My fever increased (100.8) and I was feeling more fatigued. I continued to feel worse and called my doctor back at the start of the third week. She ordered for another covid test at the mobile test center. I went and got teated the next day. This time my nose felt assaulted and the swab felt like it was done correctly based on others experiences with the test. 
The next day my fever startd to increase and continued to increase for a few days. Waking up at 101.3 and going to bed at 102.6. On Saturday, I habe a really bad migraine and feel even weaker than I had been. I feel mlre short of breath than usualm I develop an ear ache and just want to sleep the entire day.

I have a 19 month old toddler. We HAVE been to the doctor, still monitoring symptoms, no diagnosis.


Symptoms:


3 days now:

Threw up

Fever 100.4*F

Rapid breathing 

Extreme lethargy, excessive sleeping

Very red sore throat

Green mucous in nose (started today, day 3)

Thick but clear sputum

Just a little bit of cough/choking starting today

Sounds like some congestion may have started in chest, but still slight

Rapid breathing is nonstop for 3 days now



We went to the doctor on Monday. Oxygen saturation was 99% so they did a strep test (negative) and sent us home. Said the breathing was probably due to fever. 

Has anyone had a young child with COVID19 that can tell me what the timeline of appearing symptoms looks like? I know it can vary, I’m just looking for answers in this world that seems to not have any. And I’m scared.

Thanks.

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t eat much now because i feel so fucking sick that i can&amp;#39;t sleep without feeling this adrenaline dizziness pumping from my chest and lungs 24/7. Its unbelievable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this shitty junk food is tempting but to experience this fatigue and heart racing pressure it&amp;#39;s not worth it anymore.  I recommend anyone to take a 15-20 minute walk in the morning and at night to keep your body moving. Don&amp;#39;t sleep all day, eat, and repeat or you will not improve your symptoms. That shits bad for our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Hi all, my mom and I have both testing positive for coronavirus. I got it first, only lost my sense of smell, the senses came back around Day 12 for me. Currently I’m on day 17 and I can say I feel recovered with no new symptoms. 

My mom, however, just tested positive yesterday. I would say she’s about day 6-7 in. Just some fatigue, no shortness of breath, and a mild cough. She had on and off days of symptoms, but her most present symptom is tiredness. She has lots of underlying health conditions such as diabetes, so I’m hoping it doesn’t make a turn for the worst. 

Now that she has tested positive, I’m the one who usually helps her out because I’ve already recovered. I gave her the virus sadly, and I’m not sure if every time I am checking her temp or close to her, I’m basically starting my virus cycle all over again or have any immunity. 

I need to be able to work (with patients) and do my internship which is around the geriatric population. I don’t want to hurt anybody and I’m constantly scared to be a danger to others, but I accept that I have to return to real life eventually in the next few months. Do you guys see a point of me *begging* to get a test again in the next few weeks? Has anyone felt their symptoms come back or gotten “reinfected?” When is the “okay” to return back to normal life?

,COVID19positive,"Hi all,

I am not sure if I am doing the right thing by making a new post (reddit newbie) but wanted to give an update on my situation with some good news: on Day 42 of my symptoms, I actually feel a bit better. Fever has been up and down in waves, I still have mild symptoms, but I feel less exhausted and I think my breathing is better. 

Also wanted to point out an interesting symptom I've had lately: when I have a fever, I tend to be fairly angry and over-hyped, while this is not my natural temper. Usually I notice it myself but still can't calm down, and when I finally go lie down or something the exhaustion quite literally falls on me. 

I was tested yesterday with a nose swab - thankfully I didn't read about the test before because darn that was unpleasant. I sure hope they will never have to test me again. They were supposed to get me the results in 24 hours (legal obligation here) but still have not heard from them. Now I just read that when tests are positives they only send the results to the GP who prescribed the test and they in turn have to contact the patients, so I guess that's my answer. My GP being overly busy I am expecting I'll get their call in the evening or so. Anyway, whatever the results I am more confident now that I can finally breath without struggles, and I know that I will get through this at some point, hopefully without other relapses and without long term damages (not counting a mild stress disorder associated with that virus!).

I wondering if any of you have recieved a diagnosis of post viral inflammation to explain and lingering symptoms of chest pain. 

I have been battling respiratory issues since the beginning of March. What started off as a dry cough soon morphed to a phlegmy one. I was unable to get tests as there are not available. I did get antibiotics which I finished 12 days ago. Phlegm is by and large gone although I have had lingering chest issues.

I have been experiencing chest pain and tightness since the antibiotics. A doctor I spoke over the phone told me it is a result of post viral inflammation and prescribed me a budesonide inhaler.

He said that these pains can take weeks to subside. **Has anyone dealt with this?**

It is rather is rather unsettling as I have not really had any hands in diagnostics. **How long did these symptoms last for you? Anything that helped you?**

,COVID19positive,"Hi everyone,

**I am on Day 48 today and still not recovered.** Wanted to share my story, see if anyone had comments/suggestions, and compare experiences.

Massachusetts, 31 years old, male, 160 lbs

Some chronic GI stuff, but no ""at risk"" COVID conditions (as far as I know)

**March 10 -** Symptom onset

* Fatigue
* Chest pain / lower throat pain
* Dry cough
* Fever (mid 100's)
* Eye pain

Started a supplement stack:

* Vitamin C &amp; D, Zinc, Turmuric/Curcumin, Quercetin, NAC

Things continued to progress. Around **March 27/28** I debated going to the hospital due to worsening chest pain and the most *brutal* fatigue I have ever experienced. Couldn't even move in bed. So weak.

I finally convinced a doctor to test me.

**March 31** \- COVID swab at drive-through

* NEGATIVE
* Also negative: Flu and strep

My PCP decided to continue treatment as if it's COVID. Due to false negative rates (25%), and the fact that I tested so late in my course (**Day 21**). Nasal viral loads low at that point.

One other key fact: I already had the Flu in January (confirmed by swab on Jan 22).

Based on my symptoms, and ruling out of the Flu, he thinks it's *very unlikely* this is something other than COVID.

**April 6th** \- my fever broke, but chest pain and fatigue remained big issues

* I was prescribed Albuterol inhaler

**April 17th** \- got an x-ray

* NORMAL result
* Ruled out pneumonia, but wondering if I need a CT Scan?

**April 19th** \- fatigue started to diminish, energy level coming back

*--- The week of April 19th I felt like I was on the recovery path ---*

**April 22nd** \- started an inhaled steroid (Arnuity) for the residual chest discomfort &amp; inflammation

**April 23rd** \- walk-in antibody test at urgent clinic (via Quest)

* NEGATIVE
* This was a shocker. How is everything negative when I feel like I am dying?

Leaves me thinking these options:

1. False negative again
2. No IgG antibodies yet as I'm not recovered (and Quest test is ONLY for IgG)
3. I am seronegative and don't / will not produce antibodies
4. I truly have some other virus

**April 26th** \- fatigue &amp; fever came back with a vengeance. Chest pain is now starting to.

Today, **April 28th**, I discontinued the inhaled steroid in case it's making things worse.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

I have an appt with a Pulmonary Specialist on Monday. Has anybody here done that? What should I expect? Any particular questions to ask, or tests to request based on my case?

Some things I have in mind:

* CT Scan
* Lung function tests
* Re-do the antibody test (whichever one includes all IgG, IgA, IgM).
   * I think LabCorp does?
* Mono reactivation - had read about this possibly causing long term cases
* Virus panel (sputum) to test for wider array of pathogens
* Breathing exercises - is there respiratory ""physical therapy""?

&lt;p&gt;I have an appt with a Pulmonary Specialist on Monday. Has anybody here done that? What should I expect? Any particular questions to ask, or tests to request based on my case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things I have in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CT Scan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung function tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-do the antibody test (whichever one includes all IgG, IgA, IgM).

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think LabCorp does?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mono reactivation - had read about this possibly causing long term cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virus panel (sputum) to test for wider array of pathogens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breathing exercises - is there respiratory &amp;quot;physical therapy&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

Ok Throat pain never lasted more than 3 days in my life, this is not the cold, nor dengue or the flu cause they hit harder.

**Week 4:** Throat pain, diarrhea, nasal flow, low fatigue, low fever cough almost non existant and shortness of breath.

1st time with shortness of breath, scared shitless and my stocks are free falling. I finally start taking azithromycin and tylenol cause i didnt see myself recovering at all.

**Week 5:** All clear. I knew about plaquenil and quercetin but i didnt have access to plaquenil, and i only took quercetin naturally with green tea, apples and onions, cant tell if they worked. 

**Now:** No reduced lung capacity, same strenght as before but i feel my stomach weaker, before i had an iron stomach.

,COVID19positive,"So I have posted a few times on here recounting my story of my 38 days with COVID.  My case started out with a sore throat for 12 days and then it changed to the more typical respitory issues with shortness of breath/burning in lungs/tightness in chest/griping at heart and inflamation of my lungs.  The inflamation in my lungs was so bad that I could not sleep for nights at a time because I couldn't rest my chest (front, side, or back) against anything due to the pressure.  I couldn't even lean against a wall or lean back in a chair without feeling my oxygen drop and not getting enough air.   I experienced  3 waves of getting better for a day or two then getting worse with changing symptoms.  I never had a fever, only had a headache in the beginning and had night sweats, dry mouth, and sweating on the palms of my feet before symptoms would come one.  No vomiting or diarrhea.

My symptoms continued through day 31 - then they just started clearing up rather quickly.  Today marks day 7 being symptom free and day 38 of the whole journey.  No more burning, no more lung pain, I can sleep on my stomach like usual, don't feel winded going up the stairs.

But here is what is kind of strange.  When I started going through my respitory part of the virus my throat stopped hurting, but looked just as bad and inflamed.  Now that my other symptoms are gone, I checked in the mirror and while my throat still does not hurt, it still looks bad like I would have a sore throat.  Is anyone else in ""recovery"" experiencing this?  I check it each day and it seems to just ever so faintly better, but it is very slight and not as good as I would hope for being a week with no other symptoms.

Another interesting thing I noticed just today - I never had a rash or anything through this whole thing, but today I saw what seemed to be mosquite like bites on my toes (itchy) and I noticed a small red rash on my foot.  From what I have seen on here and in articles, that can be a sign of COVID.  Just curious if anyone got these symptoms after the more serious symptoms subsided and during ""recovery"".

I'm still in self-quarenteen and plan to stay in this room until 14 days of no symptom.  But I'm wondering if I need to stay in here until my throat inflammation clears up no matter how long that takes.  It seems like the true sign that the virus is still with me.  Anyone else experiencing this?

Any thoughts or similar symptoms to share?  Anyone recovered that had the lingering bad looking throat?  How long did it take to clear up?

Really hoping it doesn't mean I'm in fake recovery and it will come back!

Using Tested Positive"" Flair without testing positive seems to be more and more common in this group.

It **is** useful to see these other reports, but it's a problem to think they are tested positive. Can there be a rule against using misleading Flair?

However, moderating this subreddit already seems like an incredible amount of very stressful work, and I'm thinking that is could hopefully reduce the workload if there were Flair people could choose to show that they have not tested positive (since people seem to be doing that anyway).

E.g. ""**I'm sure it's COVID (but unconfirmed)**"" and ""**Wasn't actually COVID!**""

~~(Also, I seem to need to post with Flair? Not sure why others don't seem to need to? So now I am using misleading flair 🤷‍♂️)~~ Fixed! (Thanks again mods!)

*I would agree that creating an ""****I believe I have COVID****"" flair (irrespective of any tests or doctor) is really not ideal given the purpose of the subreddit...to talk about actually confirmed cases.

,COVID19positive,"I am a white male, age 46 years old, 6ft 2' 215 lbs. I live in Southwest Georgia. 

My back went out, and I laid on the floor for 8 days not wanting to risk going to the hospital. The injury turned into acute muscle spams that created huge nerve pain in my lower back. I wasn't able to take it anymore, and went to the hospital, where 19 people have died from the virus, and 156 positive confirmations.

On the evening of 4/23 I went to the hospital for treatment for my injury. I was in the hospital for probably 3 hours. I was wearing a mask the whole time, mine is a mask that is used for painting, has the cartridges on the front.

I tried not to touch to much, but my back went out inside the hospital, and my face was laying against the hospital bed, I couldn't move. The paper was ripped of, so just the hospital bed without the paper on it. 

I got home, and was unable to take a shower until the next day. I did get my hands and face washed thoroughly, and was able to put on pj's, barely. I was able to take a shower the next morning.

Now I have a slightly sore throat coming on, more like a dry throat. I do not know if it is allergies,....or if I am starting to present symptoms. I do not have a headache, no loss of smell, nor a temperature.

However my throat is very dry. Did anyone here have a very dry throat as the first symptom? Any nasal drainage down the back of the throat?

My question is, what symptoms will be the first to start to present if I have it. I heard the incubation time averages 4.5 days? Google just shows common symptoms, not in the order they appear, would really like to know.

I have a second house on my property, which I have quarantined myself from my family in, since I know the last place anyone wants to go is the hospital at this time.

,COVID19positive,"I'll first preface this by saying **I am not a doctor**. Please do not consider this medical advice. I am simply passing along what I heard from my doctor and some additional reading. It is still very important to remember that if you have concerns about long-lasting symptoms or are considering any kind of treatment to please discuss with your doctor. 

My story with Covid-19: It started as mild, cold-like symptoms on about March 23rd -- little bit of a sore throat and sinus congestion -- by about the 28th I had many of the classic Covid symptoms: shortness of breath, chest tightness, cough, joint pain, aches, headache, and a mild fever. The headache and fever disappeared first (by about the 3rd or 4th day) and the rest of the symptoms stuck around with slowly dissipating severity. After about 11 days, I mostly felt like myself except an occasional lingering cough and I was still easily winded, but that's not anything particularly unusual for a lung infection. I have no known underlying conditions and overall my case was considered mild.  

After feeling better for a little more than a week, I did a little bit of light yardwork. Nothing too strenuous, just some raking and sweeping pine needles off my roof. By that evening I felt like I had been hit by a bus -- I was winded and had shortness of breath, I was achy all over, dizzy and lightheaded, had paresthesia (pins and needles) all over my head and various parts of my body, and was just *exhausted.* The next day my chest was tight and I had a headache, and my knees, left shoulder, and left elbow were tight and painful, and tender to the touch. I figured that my assumption (based on doctor's advice) that the infection was cleared was wrong, or that I had been reinfected. I felt mostly better after 3 days, and since then I'll get occasional ""waves"" of joint pain, chills, headaches, dizziness, chest tightness, mild sore throat, mild cough, memory/cognitive difficulty, paresthesia, fatigue, etc. 

After speaking to my doctor, there seems to be a solid chance that what I'm experiencing, and what many others on this board and elsewhere are experiencing (namely seeming to be recovered only to have the same or similar symptoms ""reactivate"" after several days or even weeks of feeling better) might be **post-viral syndrome/post-viral inflammation**. 

What that means is that the infection is *most likely* cleared. It is still possible to test positive even if you are no longer likely contagious, which means it's either a false positive result or you may still have some dead/inactive/trace amounts of Covid virus material circulating through your body. Again, talk to your doctor first, and if you can afford to you might want to err on the side of caution anyway and continue to isolate if you are experiencing these long-term symptoms, *especially* a high fever. There are also likely some people that simply take a *really* long time to clear the infection!

So, although the infection is likely cleared, post-viral syndrome is basically when your immune system stays in attack mode. The symptoms can be broad, and many of them can overlap with covid symptoms. This includes shortness of breath, joint pain, body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion, sleep problems, dizziness, cognitive issues, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and a bunch of others, even low-grade fever. These symptoms are typically exacerbated with physical exertion. Post-viral syndrome can last for weeks or even months, though most people improve as time goes on. If it lasts longer than 6 months it is sometimes called chronic fatigue syndrome, which for some unlucky people can last years. It's worth noting that there is a correlation between post-viral syndrome/chronic fatigue syndrome and depressive episodes, and it may cause or ""activate"" depression, particularly among those that are already prone to it.

Post viral syndrome can technically occur after almost any viral infection including the common cold, but it is more common with certain infections. Mono is probably the most well-known, as it isn't uncommon for patients with mono to clear the infection within 2-3 weeks, but not fully recover for months. Post viral syndrome with the symptoms myself and many others on this sub are experiencing also appears to be fairly common among those that recovered from SARS1 and MERS. 

The good news is that if what a lot of us are experiencing *is* post viral syndrome/inflammation, then we are likely not contagious, we probably have covid antibodies, we probably aren't dealing with an infection that lasts months or longer, and we likely are past the danger zone and won't die because of the virus. We can likely resume our normal lives for the most part. The bad news is that there is no cure for post-viral syndrome, the symptoms are very real and can be very impactful, and it can linger for a long time. The instructions I was given were basically if my symptoms become unmanageable, I could be given prescription-strength anti-inflammatory meds to hopefully mitigate symptoms. However in the meantime, the advice is to stay hydrated, don't over-exert myself, and stay away from foods that can cause inflammatory responses -- for me that means sugar, some processed foods, and foods high in simple carbohydrates. I've also been incorporating more foods in my diet with anti inflammatory properties like spinach, avocado, turmeric, and others. Your mileage may vary, and this is my anecdotal experience, but I noticed that on days where I avoided ""bad"" foods I overall felt much better (if not 100%), and on a day where I ate some ice cream my symptoms flared up and I felt terrible for at least 24 hours. 

Anyway, just wanted to pass this along. Again, please talk to your doctor, but if you're still symptomatic but it comes in waves and/or you are no longer testing positive/don't have a high fever, it might be worth it to bring up the possibility with your doctor.",t2_55n95,False,,0,False,For those with long (3+ weeks) presentation of symptoms: something to consider,[],r/COVID19positive,False,,,0,,False,t3_g99kat,False,dark,0.98,#ff8717,public,128,0,{},,e7750eea-6c83-11ea-863e-0e45e32ceb3d,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question-to those who tested positive,False,128,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588050755.0,text,,,,text,self.COVID19positive,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll first preface this by saying &lt;strong&gt;I am not a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;.

The instructions I was given were basically if my symptoms become unmanageable, I could be given prescription-strength anti-inflammatory meds to hopefully mitigate symptoms. However in the meantime, the advice is to stay hydrated, don&amp;#39;t over-exert myself, and stay away from foods that can cause inflammatory responses -- for me that means sugar, some processed foods, and foods high in simple carbohydrates. I&amp;#39;ve also been incorporating more foods in my diet with anti inflammatory properties like spinach, avocado, turmeric, and others. Your mileage may vary, and this is my anecdotal experience, but I noticed that on days where I avoided &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; foods I overall felt much better (if not 100%), and on a day where I ate some ice cream my symptoms flared up and I felt terrible for at least 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, just wanted to pass this along. Again, please talk to your doctor, but if you&amp;#39;re still symptomatic but it comes in waves and/or you are no longer testing positive/don&amp;#39;t have a high fever, it might be worth it to bring up the possibility with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

 Symptoms: extreme tiredness, foggy brain, slight dry cough, pounding headache, and my lymph nodes above my collarbones swelled up to the size of newborn kittens and were very painful; I could almost constantly feel my heartbeat in the hollow of my throat. No noticeable fever. Start to finish it lasted almost 3 weeks. Constantly wondering if it was Covid.

Feb. 25th-28th: Felt extremely tired and exhausted, slept every day after work and had no energy for anything. Slight dry cough but didn't think much of it at the time. Pounding headache upon standing up, bending down, and with any strong movements.

February 29th: felt better, relatively normal. Was able to clean and manage household tasks.

March 1st: Woke up and fatigue was back; I attributed it to having had a few drinks and staying up too late the night before. Supraclavical lymph node on left side was slightly swollen and very tender. 

March 2nd: Woke up with lymph node much more swollen and downright painful. Throat feels swollen and it's hard to swallow because of the lymph node swelling. Visited PCP, he didn't run tests but prescribed an antibiotic and set a follow up for two weeks down the line. Got home and slept all afternoon, woke up to eat and stayed awake for maybe 4 hours before crashing back out and sleeping all night. 

Nothing really changes for the next few days, but the right supraclavical lymph node swells up as well starting 03/03. I sleep most of the days away. When I'm awake I can't do much without becoming so exhausted that I have to rest. My body hurt from laying down for so long. 

Swelling was noticably down by 7th or so, still very painful. Swelling and pain didn't go fully down until around March 14th. Tiredness persisted, though definitely better, through around March 10th.

Pounding headache came and went the whole time. The heartbeat in my throat persisted through all of this and still happens from time to time. The cough lasted about a week but was never very bad. Never had a noticeable fever. Had diarrhea a few times over these few weeks but only once or twice.

The weirdest part of this for me was the extreme fatigue like nothing I'd ever experienced before and the swollen lymph nodes. I get sick with strep multiple times a year and have had pneumonia and bronchitis a few times in the past. The lymph nodes under my jaw swell up frequently when I'm sick but my supraclavical lymph nodes have never swelled up before. Nothing has ever made me feel as drained as this illness did.

,COVID19positive,"My roommate looks pretty sick. It looks like he has a flu but obviously we don't know till he gets tested and get the result.

He told me couple people got tested Positive at his work. He also said his brother in law got Corona, almost died and was on oxygen for few days. (he claimed he hasn't seen him for few weeks)

We are just roommates from craigslist. We just share the place, no hangouts. That is it.

Here is the thing. He talks like he is ENTITLED to stay at home even if he is tested Positive. (Tenant Rights?) He said hospital will only treat you for few days and they will just send you home still with Corona in your system.

I asked if he could stay with his family. Of course just like I Predicted, he said they don't have enough space for him and he doesn't want his brother in law sick again and his nieces.

I asked 'Is it because we (other roommate and I) are not as important as your family?' (which is just a fact. ) But he said he cares about everyone and Humanity. yeah right.

He was saying Hey corona is not that bad. you will just get sick for a week like a flu and you will be fine. we are not even 60s so we don't have to worry.

I also told him about the fact other roommate and I don't have Insurance. he said they treat you for Free these days so we don't have to worry.

He is saying he will just stay at his room and minimize his movement and everything would be fine.

Look, I am not Stupid. He wants to do that because we are just Strangers from CL. Our lives don't matter to him just like I don't have feelings for others I hear on news.

What if all of us gets sick? He can just move the hell out, I won't see him Forever.

I didn't ask him yet about staying at motel temporarily but I am sure he will come up with excuses about money. (meaning our lives are worth less than $500\~1000)

I know Tenant Law is pretty strict. so I Can't just kick him out.

,COVID19positive,"This virus sure has been a ride of stress and insanity. I had what could be called a ""mild"" case.  The worst was two days of all over body aches and a low-grade fever and a terrible headache for two weeks. I had had the following symptoms: a sore throat, burning sinuses, a runny nose, body aches, a weird pain in my neck, fluttering heart, and extreme fatigue. I have felt almost human minus the fatigue for the last 3 weeks, and feeling grateful. 

Two weeks ago I had an antibody test done at an independent lab, it was basically just a yes/no IgG/IgM test. I tested negative for the antibodies, and positive for the IgM which is basically the result you would get at the beginning of an illness and certainly not a month out. I followed up with my doctor to see what she though, she said that she couldn't rule out that I was still contagious a month later since I had IgM showing up, but it's hard to tell because the test that I took was very yes/no and they have a higher fail rate. 

Today I took another Antibody test through my doctor, this was a full blood draw that is being sent to the lab and it will show actual levels not just yes/no. I scared and excited to know. I realize antibodies do not mean immune especially since so much is unknown about the virus, but I'm going to feel a lot better if I have them since I will consider myself recovered by that point, at the bare minimum I don't want to have IgM showing up again, that thought that a person can be infectious 1 month out is scary.

,COVID19positive,"Hi I would like to share my symptom timeline, it’s different than many media symptom reports. More like a classic SARS1 white paper symptom timeline. I am a 28 year old runner without any pre existing conditions 

I probably got covid19 it on a buisness trip in NYC but I didn’t experience symptoms until I flew back to my home state

Mid March, day 1: sore throat and runny nose

day 2: low grade fever 99.9 and sore throat runny nose

day 3: low grade fever 99.9 and sore throat and runny nose

day 4: fever gone. shortness of breath/dyspnea and costochronditis hit me like a train. I immediately knew this was covid. Called a teledoc doctor and he said since I was in NYC early March it’s definitely covid19

day 5: dyspnea gets worse. I feel like I am always running. Not hungry at all. Lost all appetite until day 20ish. I always cough after eating from this day forward. I rarely cough otherwise. I sneeze now everyday from from here on out at least once. 

day 6: shortness of breath keeps getting worse. I feel like I am always swimming in the ocean. I want a break but I have to keep swimming. I cannot talk for long without being out of breath while I have dyspnea 

day 7: I get a pulse oximeter ordered from amazon. 96% and pulse 100+. still dyspnea and chest pain 

day 8: I go into urgent care with dyspnea and a n95 mask. I felt like I was suffocating with that mask. Xray EKG and O2 and pulse measured. Clear chest xray. Doc thinks I dont have covid19 but anxiety. He only gives it to me because of NYC travel. I go home. Doc says if spO2 goes below 94% go to ER

day 9-13: dyspnea. I feel like I am suffocating. I found I have to sleep upright sitting or on my stomach to be able to sleep and breath. I continue to do this even today to relieve chest pain

day 14: I am an active runner that enjoys being out of breath but not like this. I have run marathons but this feels like 4 marathons in a row every day with no breaks. My spO2 is 95-96%. Test comes back positive for sars-cov-2/covid19. 

day 15:still dyspnea and chest pain. I did not think I was going to survive this. A lot of physical and emotional suffering 

day 16: Teledoc doc recommendeds I go to ER for blood work and checkup for myocarditis and rule out bacterial lung infection or other idiopathic infections. I decide to go to ER. It was the first time I saw the light of day after many days of quarantine. I get ct scan of heart lungs and bloodwork. Only have covid19 infection. I have a mild problem with my heart. Clear chest ct scan. Test positive for covid19 again. They give me the option to be in patient and be monitored. I decide to be discharged from hospital to prevent a potential nosocomial infection  

day 17-20: dyspnea/shortness of breath is the worst it has ever been. SpO2% still above 95%

day 21: dyspnea fades quickly and I can talk again. Pulse goes from 100ish to 70ish. Costochrondritis is still present with headaches. It feels like someone hit me in the chest with a baseball bat. It feels like real trauma. 

day 21-day 30 Costochrondritis is painful and unrelenting. I sleep 10-15 hours a day. I look forward to sleeping to null pain. I do not take any anti inflammatory for fear of side affects.

day 30-35 current: Costochrondritis is slowly getting better. Pulse is 50-60. I have headaches still everyday. I ordered a neck collar off amazon that helps with my neck position when I sleep upright and helps take off some headache pain

day 36: I decide to go for a run because I am worried I have PAH or PVOD. I can run which is a good sign. I get shortness of breath when I get back to my car and rest.

Day 37: all the symptoms come back probably due to running. Runny nose ,sore throat, etc Decide to take it easy today

Day 38: I feel like pre running days. Chest pain and headaches. I have lost around 25 pounds since day 1

 I called a doctor and he has ordered blood work. I have a referral to see a cardiologist for a echo-cardiogram to see if I have PAH or PVOD. Doctor also ordered another covid test to see if I am still positive. He suspects I might still be fighting the virus due to my symptom flare up. I would also like to test negative before seeing cardiologist in person for tests. He will order antibodies test in the future 

I am not a doctor. This is not medical advice and seek a health professional. These tips are my opinion only and not to be taken as facts:

Tips for others

 1 Get a spO2 monitor and temperature. 

2 Always check your o2 and temperature everyday. 

3 Sleep upright in a sitting position with a neck cast or collar, or sleep on your stomach. Do not sleep on your back or side

4 have heard sleep apnea devices can help get you more oxygen without a ventilator and can monitor your o2 levels while you sleep. I wish I had one. I would wake up choking out of breath at night and I think I was lucky to keep above 95% o2 without checking myself while I slept

5 multivitamin with vitamin D everyday

6 Sleep without an alarm clock. Take time off from work if you need to

7 Get blood work done if you can after being cleared from quarantine to check for d dimer blood clotting, BNP, metabolic panel, c reactive protien, etc. 

I am grateful others post here because I feel I am not alone that others experience symptoms for so long. I had the flu a few years ago and I was over it in 4 days. SARS-COV-2 has taken me almost 10 times as long and I am still not recovered ",t2_6bmnd823,False,,0,False,38 day covid19 symptom timeline with ER visit,[],r/COVID19positive,False,,,0,,False,t3_g9d8x3,False,dark,0.94,,public,27,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tested Positive - Me,False,27,,False,self,1588123120.0,,[],{},,True,,1588063540.0,text,,,,text,self.COVID19positive,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi I would like to share my symptom timeline, it’s different than many media symptom reports. More like a classic SARS1 white paper symptom timeline. I am a 28 year old runner without any pre existing conditions &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably got covid19 it on a buisness trip in NYC but I didn’t experience symptoms until I flew back to my home state&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid March, day 1: sore throat and runny nose&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 2: low grade fever 99.9 and sore throat runny nose&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 3: low grade fever 99.9 and sore throat and runny nose&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 4: fever gone. shortness of breath/dyspnea and costochronditis hit me like a train. I immediately knew this was covid. Called a teledoc doctor and he said since I was in NYC early March it’s definitely covid19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 5: dyspnea gets worse. I feel like I am always running. Not hungry at all. Lost all appetite until day 20ish. I always cough after eating from this day forward. I rarely cough otherwise. I sneeze now everyday from from here on out at least once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 6: shortness of breath keeps getting worse. I feel like I am always swimming in the ocean. I want a break but I have to keep swimming. I cannot talk for long without being out of breath while I have dyspnea &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 7: I get a pulse oximeter ordered from amazon. 96% and pulse 100+. still dyspnea and chest pain &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 8: I go into urgent care with dyspnea and a n95 mask. I felt like I was suffocating with that mask. Xray EKG and O2 and pulse measured. Clear chest xray. Doc thinks I dont have covid19 but anxiety. He only gives it to me because of NYC travel. I go home. Doc says if spO2 goes below 94% go to ER&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 9-13: dyspnea. I feel like I am suffocating. I found I have to sleep upright sitting or on my stomach to be able to sleep and breath. I continue to do this even today to relieve chest pain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 14: I am an active runner that enjoys being out of breath but not like this. I have run marathons but this feels like 4 marathons in a row every day with no breaks. My spO2 is 95-96%. Test comes back positive for sars-cov-2/covid19. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 15:still dyspnea and chest pain. I did not think I was going to survive this. A lot of physical and emotional suffering &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 16: Teledoc doc recommendeds I go to ER for blood work and checkup for myocarditis and rule out bacterial lung infection or other idiopathic infections. I decide to go to ER. It was the first time I saw the light of day after many days of quarantine. I get ct scan of heart lungs and bloodwork. Only have covid19 infection. I have a mild problem with my heart. Clear chest ct scan. Test positive for covid19 again. They give me the option to be in patient and be monitored. I decide to be discharged from hospital to prevent a potential nosocomial infection  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 17-20: dyspnea/shortness of breath is the worst it has ever been. SpO2% still above 95%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 21: dyspnea fades quickly and I can talk again. Pulse goes from 100ish to 70ish. Costochrondritis is still present with headaches. It feels like someone hit me in the chest with a baseball bat. It feels like real trauma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 21-day 30 Costochrondritis is painful and unrelenting. I sleep 10-15 hours a day. I look forward to sleeping to null pain. I do not take any anti inflammatory for fear of side affects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 30-35 current: Costochrondritis is slowly getting better. Pulse is 50-60. I have headaches still everyday. I ordered a neck collar off amazon that helps with my neck position when I sleep upright and helps take off some headache pain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;day 36: I decide to go for a run because I am worried I have PAH or PVOD. I can run which is a good sign. I get shortness of breath when I get back to my car and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 37: all the symptoms come back probably due to running. Runny nose ,sore throat, etc Decide to take it easy today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 38: I feel like pre running days. Chest pain and headaches. I have lost around 25 pounds since day 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I called a doctor and he has ordered blood work. I have a referral to see a cardiologist for a echo-cardiogram to see if I have PAH or PVOD. Doctor also ordered another covid test to see if I am still positive. He suspects I might still be fighting the virus due to my symptom flare up. I would also like to test negative before seeing cardiologist in person for tests. He will order antibodies test in the future &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a doctor. This is not medical advice and seek a health professional. These tips are my opinion only and not to be taken as facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tips for others&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 1 Get a spO2 monitor and temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Always check your o2 and temperature everyday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Sleep upright in a sitting position with a neck cast or collar, or sleep on your stomach. Do not sleep on your back or side&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 have heard sleep apnea devices can help get you more oxygen without a ventilator and can monitor your o2 levels while you sleep. I wish I had one. I would wake up choking out of breath at night and I think I was lucky to keep above 95% o2 without checking myself while I slept&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 multivitamin with vitamin D everyday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 Sleep without an alarm clock. Take time off from work if you need to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 Get blood work done if you can after being cleared from quarantine to check for d dimer blood clotting, BNP, metabolic panel, c reactive protien, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"**Wow this turned out to be way longer than I thought. TDLR at the bottom.**

A little about me: 26 year old female, BMI of 17.4 (underweight). Possible risk factors include: low body weight (thanks, Rona), congenital long QT syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and low blood pressure. Tested positive for COVID on April 3rd.

So I'm not exactly sure when I contracted COVID. I'm either 61 or 45 days into this, as you'll see below.

On February 26th I went to my doctor with complaints of a low grade fever and scratchy throat. At that time there were zero confirmed cases of the virus in my city, but I was concerned due to the nature of my job. (I work face-to-face with visitors at my city's largest library. The library itself is one of the most popular tourist attractions in town, so I spend a lot of time with international travelers.) My doctor wanted to test me, but due to strict CDC guidelines, it couldn't happen.

From February 26th to March 8th, my symptoms stayed the same, but my low grade fever was inching up (99.7F). My doctor reached out to me and told me I should try to get tested for COVID now. So I set up an after hours appointment with a different doctor who would screen me before administering the test. Except... she didn't think I had it because I hadn't left the country, so no test for me.

I should say that I stopped going to work February 26th due to my anxiety about COVID. From February 26th to March 13th the only times I left the house were to get groceries (wore mask + glasses), visit my family, and see my cardiologist. I say this because if I really was sick with COVID during this time, it would be really strange for none of my family members to show symptoms (some have health risks). To this day, my family members haven't shown any symptoms. Also, I live with my boyfriend and he hasn't shown any symptoms either.

On March 13th I had an appointment with my cardiologist. This is where I think I might have picked up COVID if I didn't already have it. I wore a mask and glasses inside the clinic and stayed away from other patients. Some were coughing (probably heart failure), and I didn't want any part of that. A tech ran an EKG on me, and my cardiologist ordered an echocardiogram to be administered that same day since my last one was outdated. This made me anxious because 1) of how intimate ultrasounds can be and 2) the lack of masks being worn by staff members. No one was wearing a mask! I told them I would be waiting outside in the fresh air while they got things ready for my echocardiogram. When I was getting the echo done, I kept my mask and glasses on. The tech and I were talking about COVID and how no one is really taking it seriously, and at one point she coughs into her elbow. I must have looked like I saw a ghost because she then told me ""Oh no, I don't have it."" *Hmm...* Anyway, after my cardiologist appointment I went home. 

My boyfriend and I have not left our apartment since March 13th (45 days now). I've only left to go to the ER and hospital.

From March 13th to April 2nd, my symptoms started to get worse. My low grade fevers were now approaching 100.0F every evening, my throat was super scratchy, my nose was congested, and I was having bouts of diarrhea. I contacted my doctor again on April 2nd, and she requested I get a COVID test. The next day I received the test at a drive-thru test site attached to my doctor's clinic. On April 5th, I found out I was positive. That was also the day my temperature finally reached 100.4F.

On April 8th I went to the ER because my heart rate was ~160bpm walking to the bathroom, my pulse ox was low that morning, and I was having some burning chest pains. They didn't even take me inside the hospital; instead, they did an EKG and X-ray in the ambulance bay. When both of those came back clear, they told me to go home and work on my anxiety.

On April 13th I went back to the same ER due to chest pain and shortness of breath. This time they actually took me to a room and did an EKG, X-ray, and some bloodwork. The EKG and bloodwork came back okay, but the X-ray showed possible pneumonia in my lower right lung. They didn't prescribe me anything for the pneumonia, so I called my doctor who prescribed me doxycycline. I finished my prescription on April 25th.

On April 16th I had an appointment to get more bloodwork done at my doctor's clinic, but my doctor ended up sending me to the hospital afterwards. She was concerned about my heart possibly being infected. I was admitted to the hospital overnight so they could observe me and administer antibiotics in case I did have a secondary infection. My vitals were normal except for some tachycardia (~130bpm). They ran a bunch of tests on my heart including a few EKGs and an echocardiogram. Those came back normal. They also took another X-ray which also came back normal despite the nurse hearing some wheezing in my right lung. All of my bloodwork came back normal, but I was concerned about some of the WBC counts. Apparently I was the only one worried, so they discharged me the evening of April 17th.

So I've been back at home since April 17th. There were a few days last week when I didn't have a low grade fever, and it was awesome. I thought I was finally over all this! Except that didn't last for long, and my temperature has been elevated again (99.7-100F). I've also noticed some skin conditions popping up this week: [red fingertips](https://imgur.com/a/igNRXyg) and a [red livedo reticularis-like discoloration](https://imgur.com/a/vautYtU) on my forearms. Low blood pressure on April 25th and 26th (~92/65). My pulse ox has been 96-99% when resting, but I do notice some mild SOB while talking. Tachycardia is also back as of this morning. 

I'm really concerned about the possibility this could get worse. I feel lucky that I didn't have the coughing and breathing issues at the beginning of my illness, but now I'm concerned it might happen. Also reading that COVID can cause blood clots is just so scary. I know that I'm pretty far into this by now, but I can't help but worry it will get worse. I want to get a CT scan of my chest, but I’m also scared by what it might show.

**TLDR: I've had Covid for either 61 days or 45 days. New symptoms are popping up, and old symptoms are returning. I'm worried it will get worse despite being past the two week mark.**

&lt;p&gt;On March 13th I had an appointment with my cardiologist. This is where I think I might have picked up COVID if I didn&amp;#39;t already have it. I wore a mask and glasses inside the clinic and stayed away from other patients. Some were coughing (probably heart failure), and I didn&amp;#39;t want any part of that. A tech ran an EKG on me, and my cardiologist ordered an echocardiogram to be administered that same day since my last one was outdated. This made me anxious because 1) of how intimate ultrasounds can be and 2) the lack of masks being worn by staff members. No one was wearing a mask! I told them I would be waiting outside in the fresh air while they got things ready for my echocardiogram. When I was getting the echo done, I kept my mask and glasses on. The tech and I were talking about COVID and how no one is really taking it seriously, and at one point she coughs into her elbow. I must have looked like I saw a ghost because she then told me &amp;quot;Oh no, I don&amp;#39;t have it.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Hmm...&lt;/em&gt; Anyway, after my cardiologist appointment I went home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I have not left our apartment since March 13th (45 days now). I&amp;#39;ve only left to go to the ER and hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From March 13th to April 2nd, my symptoms started to get worse. My low grade fevers were now approaching 100.0F every evening, my throat was super scratchy, my nose was congested, and I was having bouts of diarrhea. I contacted my doctor again on April 2nd, and she requested I get a COVID test. The next day I received the test at a drive-thru test site attached to my doctor&amp;#39;s clinic. On April 5th, I found out I was positive. That was also the day my temperature finally reached 100.4F.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 8th I went to the ER because my heart rate was ~160bpm walking to the bathroom, my pulse ox was low that morning, and I was having some burning chest pains. They didn&amp;#39;t even take me inside the hospital; instead, they did an EKG and X-ray in the ambulance bay. When both of those came back clear, they told me to go home and work on my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 13th I went back to the same ER due to chest pain and shortness of breath. This time they actually took me to a room and did an EKG, X-ray, and some bloodwork. The EKG and bloodwork came back okay, but the X-ray showed possible pneumonia in my lower right lung. They didn&amp;#39;t prescribe me anything for the pneumonia, so I called my doctor who prescribed me doxycycline. I finished my prescription on April 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 16th I had an appointment to get more bloodwork done at my doctor&amp;#39;s clinic, but my doctor ended up sending me to the hospital afterwards. She was concerned about my heart possibly being infected. I was admitted to the hospital overnight so they could observe me and administer antibiotics in case I did have a secondary infection. My vitals were normal except for some tachycardia (~130bpm). They ran a bunch of tests on my heart including a few EKGs and an echocardiogram. Those came back normal. They also took another X-ray which also came back normal despite the nurse hearing some wheezing in my right lung. All of my bloodwork came back normal, but I was concerned about some of the WBC counts. Apparently I was the only one worried, so they discharged me the evening of April 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been back at home since April 17th. There were a few days last week when I didn&amp;#39;t have a low grade fever, and it was awesome. I thought I was finally over all this! Except that didn&amp;#39;t last for long, and my temperature has been elevated again (99.7-100F). I&amp;#39;ve also noticed some skin conditions popping up this week: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/igNRXyg""&gt;red fingertips&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/vautYtU""&gt;red livedo reticularis-like discoloration&lt;/a&gt; on my forearms. Low blood pressure on April 25th and 26th (~92/65). My pulse ox has been 96-99% when resting, but I do notice some mild SOB while talking. Tachycardia is also back as of this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really concerned about the possibility this could get worse. I feel lucky that I didn&amp;#39;t have the coughing and breathing issues at the beginning of my illness, but now I&amp;#39;m concerned it might happen. Also reading that COVID can cause blood clots is just so scary. I know that I&amp;#39;m pretty far into this by now, but I can&amp;#39;t help but worry it will get worse. I want to get a CT scan of my chest, but I’m also scared by what it might show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: I&amp;#39;ve had Covid for either 61 days or 45 days. New symptoms are popping up, and old symptoms are returning. I&amp;#39;m worried it will get worse despite being past the two week mark.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone else have their fever and other symptoms return late in the game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Hey everyone, first off, a little background. 27M, moderately healthy, played sports for years prior to this but was sedentary for the half a year prior to Covid Pandemic. Smoker, but quit right when I felt symptoms.

So I was tested on 3/25, went into urgent care with a shortness of breath and chest tightness. Positive result came back 4/4.

The whole time, I had shortness of breath, chest tightness, fatigue, aches all over and weird heart rate problem. 

I’m currently in week 5, with shortness of breath and sharp chest pain that comes and goes. Frequency is a lot shorter than the first few weeks for sure. It last for hours daily instead of just being constant now. 

In between that 5 weeks, I’ve went into urgent care 4 times(?).With two x rays, one at week 1 and one at the end of week 4, and did 2 EKG and everything came back normal. No pneumonia, nothing. The pain and aches in my chest were pretty painful though, as well as the shortness of breath. There were quite a lot of nights where I really didn’t sleep well tbh in fear of just not breathing.

I’m just wondering if anyone else have the same thing as me, and if so, what did your doctor said or suspect is going on in your chest? The doctors never said anything except that it’s inflammation and it’s healing.

&lt;p&gt;Side note, I have lower Blood pressure and heart rate  as well throughout this whole thing, diastolic always within low 60s and at times 58-59. Anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: to clarify, never had a cough or fever.&lt;/p&gt;

We live in Queens, been staying inside since March 13th except to walk the dog and store a few times. Neighbor died from it four weeks ago. 

I’ve felt crummy, low grade fever on and off since end of March. Chest tightness, “tickle” or irritation in chest/throat, fatigue. Was treated for kidney infection April 3rd to 14th, which resolved. Still had an elevated temp, worn down, taking Tylenol a few times a day.

22nd, woke up again with temp of 99.9°, worse body pain, more intense chest/center back pain, headache, dizziness, insides hurt. Had telemed visit with Mt. Sinai, told anyone presenting with these symptoms given presumptive positive dx for CDC tracking. Will do antibody test when available. Doc said quarantine for 7 days plus 72 hours fever free, take OTC meds and Zinc. 

Temp stayed around 99° even on Tylenol. Sense of smell/taste was muted for 4 days but not entirely gone. Yesterday, went back to normal. My temp today is a 99° but feeling a bit better, still worn out.

I am a 27 year old male in good shape, don’t smoke, I do drink a lot. I had childhood asthma but no other medical conditions. I’ll just list below how my experience has been. I believe at this point I am about a week and a half in. 

Friday/Saturday 17-18 April

This is when I first began to feel sick. It started with a sore throat and diarrhea that lasted throughout that weekend. No other symptoms presented at this point.

Monday-Friday 20-24 April

Started Monday with all over body aches, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, sore throat, stuffy nose, eyes hurt to move to look around, I was light headed, no appetite what so ever and a fever. The fever was just a cycle of chills and sweats. All of these symptoms persisted from Monday-Friday. Didn’t have any break in fever the whole time. My temperature mostly hovered in the 101-102 Fahrenheit range. I was taking maximum strength DayQuil during the week, as often as allowed and it definitely helped with the pains at least. 

Saturday-Sunday 25-26 April

Mostly felt pretty good during this time. My throat pain still lingered, the fever had gone which was a huge relief, and the body aches became very manageable. At this point I mostly felt normal other than still feeling quite fatigued. During this time I started to develop a small cough, just happening very occasionally, sometimes with phlegm, usually without. 

Sunday night things became weird. I had felt fine and was sitting on the couch when I very quickly felt my face become hot. Went to look in the mirror and had a rash covering my whole face and neck. At this point, not having any Benadryl I decided that I would be seen. Went to the hospital where I was admitted for labs. Was told that I probably have Covid but due to limited testing I still probably wouldn’t be tested. I got chest X-rays that revealed I have viral pneumonia on the left side of my lungs and at that point a Covid test was ordered. I was discharged and told to just rest, continue taking care of myself like I had been and to return to the hospital if breathing becomes difficult.

,COVID19positive,"EDIT: Presumed positive by my doctor on the 11th March. At that time testing was only available for severe cases in the UK. So although not 100% confirmed, what I had was most probably covid19.

This is my first ever post on this site. The only reason I am here is because in a moment of desperation to understand what was going on in my body I stumbled across this thread last night, and boy am I glad I found it.

So I'm a 25 year old Male and a presumed positive (just got tested today). My illness started exactly 7 weeks ago today. The 1st week consisted of raging fevers, stomach cramps, nausea, lack of appetite, insomnia, and brain fog. By Week 2, the fever was gone but the rest of the symptoms remained. As weird as it sounds, my brain felt bruised and despite sleeping normally now, I still woke up feeling tired. It was at this point I started suffering from really bad lower back pain which I thought was weird (only when I found this subreddit did I realise it was just another symptom of the virus). By week 3 nearly all the symptoms had gone except the brain fog and ""pressure"" like headache, no pain just pressure. At this point I thought I was over the worst and started going back to my daily life. I even started jogging that week. By the end of the week all symptoms were gone and I felt great and optimistic. Little did I know what was to come next.

By the beginning of Week 4 the brain fog returned with a vengeance. I also developed a dry cough (which I barely had in week 1) and shortness of breath (never had this before). My lungs felt bruised and filled with muck. I was really perplexed at this point. I started wondering if I had caught the virus again (I had been jogging in the local park filled with other people). Little did I realise at the time that exercise reactivates the virus. By Week 5 the cough was mostly gone and my lungs were on the mend but I had the worst case of insomnia ever. I barely slept at all, 4 straight hours was considered a good night. I felt weak, constantly tired and just washed out. By Week 6 the GI symptoms returned. I was off my food again and nauseous. I really had no idea what was going on at this point and the GP was not helpful in the least. The medication he prescribed just made me feel worse so I stopped taking it.

Through to week 6 and the situation remained the same. I was barely sleeping, barely eating, and just about surviving. I felt physically weak and basic mental tasks were exhausting. Throughout my life whenever I fell ill I turned to exercise. I was a firm believer that exercise and physical activity helps the body recover so I started going on long walks in a desperate attempt to get over whatever I was suffering from (and to tire my body out so I could at least get some shut eye). But as you can guess, instead of helping the exercise just made things worse. I was the sickest I had been throughout my life.

It was last night (end of Week 6) that I came across this subreddit and thank God I did. I now realise what had happened and the mistakes I had made up to this point. I might sound naive but I thought I had gotten over the covid at the end of week 2 so I couldn't understand why I still felt ill. But at least I now know. All day today I have rested as much as possible and taken all the steps necessary to help my body deal with this virus. I also finally got tested today so at least I can know if the virus is still active or not.

I'm thankful I have found this subreddit as it at least gives me some reassurance that others are also suffering something similar. There's nothing scarier and more depressing than being ill and not knowing why.

Little did I know what was to come next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the beginning of Week 4 the brain fog returned with a vengeance. I also developed a dry cough (which I barely had in week 1) and shortness of breath (never had this before). My lungs felt bruised and filled with muck. I was really perplexed at this point. I started wondering if I had caught the virus again (I had been jogging in the local park filled with other people). Little did I realise at the time that exercise reactivates the virus. By Week 5 the cough was mostly gone and my lungs were on the mend but I had the worst case of insomnia ever. I barely slept at all, 4 straight hours was considered a good night. I felt weak, constantly tired and just washed out. By Week 6 the GI symptoms returned. I was off my food again and nauseous. I really had no idea what was going on at this point and the GP was not helpful in the least. The medication he prescribed just made me feel worse so I stopped taking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through to week 6 and the situation remained the same. I was barely sleeping, barely eating, and just about surviving. I felt physically weak and basic mental tasks were exhausting. Throughout my life whenever I fell ill I turned to exercise. I was a firm believer that exercise and physical activity helps the body recover so I started going on long walks in a desperate attempt to get over whatever I was suffering from (and to tire my body out so I could at least get some shut eye). But as you can guess, instead of helping the exercise just made things worse. I was the sickest I had been throughout my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was last night (end of Week 6) that I came across this subreddit and thank God I did. I now realise what had happened and the mistakes I had made up to this point. I might sound naive but I thought I had gotten over the covid at the end of week 2 so I couldn&amp;#39;t understand why I still felt ill. But at least I now know. All day today I have rested as much as possible and taken all the steps necessary to help my body deal with this virus. I also finally got tested today so at least I can know if the virus is still active or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thankful I have found this subreddit as it at least gives me some reassurance that others are also suffering something similar. There&amp;#39;s nothing scarier and more depressing than being ill and not knowing why. I pray we can all quickly get over this virus.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"A little background about myself to preface this. I am 22 years old, and workout, and play basketball. I eat relatively healthy, and don't get sick very often, before this, it was 2-3 times in the past 4 years that I got sick, and it was something that only lasted a couple days. I will say that I take a few hits every week of a spliff (mix of weed and tobacco) when I'm hanging out with one of my friends. And take a hit or two of weed regularly, I'd say everyother day on average.

It started out Tuesday Feb 25th, and the week prior I had just bought a JUUL, after quitting many times, but I've only cumulatively used it for 4-5 months of my life. I've been teaching myself to code, and living with my parents, who were set to leave that weekend. That timeframe leading up to the Tuesday had been perfect, playing my newly bought xbox, making progress in my lessons, and getting out every now and then to play basketball. No ill effects of the Juul had began to take place yet, i.e. horrible withdrawals.

That Tuesday I went out to play basketball at a local park. The night before my throat had been a little scratchy, which I attributed to the Juul. I played hard with 3 others that I met there for a couple hours, and shared water with one of them, since I hadn't brought my own and the fountains were closed due to it being winter. I decided when I got home that I'd quit my Juul, since I felt that it was making my throat feel dry and scratchy. My whole body was aching when I got home, which I thought was from playing basketball. The Thursday that my parents leave they wake me up to tell me that they're leaving, after I spent a whole night lying awake with an excruciating headache (likely from quitting nicotine) and what was surely a fever (didn't know where the thermometer was at the time to verify, but I had a really warm forehead).

They leave, and suddenly cases are popping up everywhere along the westcoast for the Coronavirus/Covid19. This is the end of Feb/beginning of March. I was spitting up white, foamy phlegm constantly and felt generally weak and lethargic. My nose was also runny. This continued for the first 3-4 days, then my parents got home from visiting my sister who lives in California, me living in Oregon.

When they got back was around the time that I started getting bouts of bad chest tightness and shortness of breath. It even got to the point that at one point I was trying to breathe but my lungs weren't opening all the way, leaving me gasping. Eventually this subsided, and I went to the doctor who told me that my symptoms and timeline match that of Covid, but I was getting better and could go out and run and exercise again. I never really had a cough and I still don't, but I was running a temp of 99.7 3 nights ago, two months later after all of this. My throat still looks red and irritated when I look at it with a camera or flashlight. And I'm still producing mucus and have postnasal drip.

,COVID19positive,"Posting from a /r/NYC thread:

&gt;March 15th: ""I got a cold"" feeling kicked in.

&gt;March 18th: ""Okay this doesn't seem like a typical cold""

&gt;March 20th: Started feeling ill.

&gt;March 23rd: Headache, Nausea, Productive cough with brown specks, sore throat, burning nasal passages, Eyes felt sore in the back.

&gt;March 28th: Headaches at the base of neck and frontal lobe, sinus pain (dryness feeling), chest tightness (but I didn't have trouble breathing), loss of taste and smell.

&gt;March 30th: Called hotline to setup appointment, after having a coughing fit and felt and heard an audible ""pop"" from my left chest.

&gt;April 3rd: Went to the ER for them to take my vitals and the attending nurse tells me ""Why are you even here, just go home. All that ""just wanting to find out shit doesn't apply here"". &lt;Went home&gt;

&gt;April 5th: Went back to ER when I spit up some blood, X-rays showed no bad signs in lungs, they didn't check for anything else I mentioned and put me down as Upper respiratory issues, marked me as possible Covid-19 but didn't test.

&gt;April 8th: Finally get tested at one of the drive thru centers. STILL felling malaise. Headaches slowed down, Appetite slowly returning. Digestive issues start to appear. Constipation, constantly dull gurgling from all quadrants of abdominal area. Found multiple blood bubbles in my mouth, two of which just popped when i saw them, and touched with tongue to see what it was.

&gt;April 11th: Positive results for test, still feeling sick. Abdominal pain alternates dull/sharp in lower abdomen.

&gt;April 15th: Pain radiates to lower back on the flanks, lower back pain that I've had kicks into overdrive. Upper back feels sore like strained muscles. Headaches back with vengeance, feeling tired/sleepy more. Drink prune juice to clear constipation.

&gt;April 18th: Retested for Covid-19, Back to ER as chest got way tighter then before and i was worried. Diagnosed with gastrointestinal problems. Told to take peptide to stop diarrhea. (Mixed messages here from medical personnel)

&gt;April 22: Results now say presumed positive. Stomach still cramping up when i sit, lay, walk. Eating pastas before wakes me up with a headache, coffee helps alleviate it when i wake up.

Since my last hospital visit, when I was told of my Blood Pressure being high (158/111), I cut back on high salts foods and gluten based foods and dont eat 3 hours before bedtime. Thankfully by doing this I no longer wake up with a splitting headaches.

The aliments currently plaguing me after all the standard Covid-19 symptoms is inflammation and abdominal pains and mild lower-back pains (from left side flank to right side flank). Urinating much more than often and insomnia. 

Back to the inflammation, my elbows, knees, center of my chest and upper-back all feel inflamed. (Tylenol does nothing for this) the pulsing down my left/right arm and left shoulder and both legs. 

My main concern in the pulsating throbbing feeling in my legs and arms which I have also felt on my lower shoulder where the axillary artery, but only this one when I was gaming and my heart started beating faster. is I'm 213LB - Starter the isolation at 235LB.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 15th: &amp;quot;I got a cold&amp;quot; feeling kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 18th: &amp;quot;Okay this doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a typical cold&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 20th: Started feeling ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 23rd: Headache, Nausea, Productive cough with brown specks, sore throat, burning nasal passages, Eyes felt sore in the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 28th: Headaches at the base of neck and frontal lobe, sinus pain (dryness feeling), chest tightness (but I didn&amp;#39;t have trouble breathing), loss of taste and smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 30th: Called hotline to setup appointment, after having a coughing fit and felt and heard an audible &amp;quot;pop&amp;quot; from my left chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 3rd: Went to the ER for them to take my vitals and the attending nurse tells me &amp;quot;Why are you even here, just go home. All that &amp;quot;just wanting to find out shit doesn&amp;#39;t apply here&amp;quot;. &amp;lt;Went home&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 5th: Went back to ER when I spit up some blood, X-rays showed no bad signs in lungs, they didn&amp;#39;t check for anything else I mentioned and put me down as Upper respiratory issues, marked me as possible Covid-19 but didn&amp;#39;t test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 8th: Finally get tested at one of the drive thru centers. STILL felling malaise. Headaches slowed down, Appetite slowly returning. Digestive issues start to appear. Constipation, constantly dull gurgling from all quadrants of abdominal area. Found multiple blood bubbles in my mouth, two of which just popped when i saw them, and touched with tongue to see what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 11th: Positive results for test, still feeling sick. Abdominal pain alternates dull/sharp in lower abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 15th: Pain radiates to lower back on the flanks, lower back pain that I&amp;#39;ve had kicks into overdrive. Upper back feels sore like strained muscles. Headaches back with vengeance, feeling tired/sleepy more. Drink prune juice to clear constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 18th: Retested for Covid-19, Back to ER as chest got way tighter then before and i was worried. Diagnosed with gastrointestinal problems. Told to take peptide to stop diarrhea. (Mixed messages here from medical personnel)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 22: Results now say presumed positive. Stomach still cramping up when i sit, lay, walk. Eating pastas before wakes me up with a headache, coffee helps alleviate it when i wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my last hospital visit, when I was told of my Blood Pressure being high (158/111), I cut back on high salts foods and gluten based foods and dont eat 3 hours before bedtime. Thankfully by doing this I no longer wake up with a splitting headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aliments currently plaguing me after all the standard Covid-19 symptoms is inflammation and abdominal pains and mild lower-back pains (from left side flank to right side flank). Urinating much more than often and insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the inflammation, my elbows, knees, center of my chest and upper-back all feel inflamed. (Tylenol does nothing for this) the pulsing down my left/right arm and left shoulder and both legs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main concern in the pulsating throbbing feeling in my legs and arms which I have also felt on my lower shoulder where the axillary artery, but only this one when I was gaming and my heart started beating faster. is I&amp;#39;m 213LB - Starter the isolation at 235LB. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should go to the ER I&amp;#39;m thinking but I&amp;#39;m tired of being sent away without the proper diagnostics, which has happened twice already. Maybe it&amp;#39;s anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"My story/symptoms/timeline:

So the week before all this started, I had one day of mild diarrhea - it came and went. On Sunday night 4/19 I was feeling just extra fatigued. 

Monday 4/20, at work, I would have these moments of severe exhaustion that would come and go throughout the day. 

Tuesday 4/21, I still had those weird exhausting periods that came and went. I felt almost like I took a bunch of Xanax or something - like severely tired for a minute and then back to normal. Then about midday that day, I developed body aches and 99.5 temp and was sent home from work. 

Weds and Thurs - same symptoms plus a slight scratchy throat and was send for testing on Thursday 4/23. 

Friday 4/24 - called with positive results. Still had body aches but actually felt a little better on this day.

Saturday 4/25 - Current - body aches and temp are back every day. Now I have resp congestion so I started taking robitussin DM based on what my doc told me to do if I develop cough and/or congestion. Yesterday, I started with the lack of taste and smell. I feel like every two days or so, it’s something new. This isn’t terrible but it’s not great. The mornings are the worst.

,COVID19positive,"Hi, I hope everyone is doing well. I just wanted to write a post that I can update about my status with the virus. This is a way for me to vent and hopefully make me feel better, but to also document how it goes for me if anyone is interested to read. 

Preface:
I'm a ""healthy"" 19 year old male. I put healthy in quotes because overall my health is good, but in no way do I have a healthy eating style.

Day 1 - April 27th, 2020
Ordinary day until about noon where I found out a person who I had close contact, has a family member who they live with test positive for COVID-19. Them being the great person they are, told me immediately. Now I dont have any symptoms no fever, no cough, no diarrhea, no aching nothing, but my anxiety levels have increased and I'm generally more nervous. I immediately cleaned and disinfected everything I came in contact with in my household and contacted my mother (who I live with) and told her. We agreed that I would isolate myself in my room and take all my belongings inside my room. I talked to a physician and they recommended me to contact my county's health department to see if I can get tested for the virus and antibodies. Right now I'm just anxious and nervous. I don't know what's to come and I don't know what to do. I still have school and work to attend but I'm sure those will get impacted because of this. I know I could be getting all worked up, but I'm just assuming the worse and want to take necessary steps to make this easier. I hope it all goes well. Stay safe.

Day 2 - April 28th, 2020
Woke up fine slept longer than usual but that is probably because I felt down. Early in the morning I called multiple numbers and found out the testing for COVID is only done with people with symptoms and as of right now I do not feel like I have any symptoms. No fatigue, fevers, coughs, diarrhea nothing. Just went to school and worked my shift for my job. It feels like I'm getting mucus at the back of the throat and a very minor headache due to my lack of eating and drinking water i believe ( I do not have a lost of appetite I just dont know what to be outside of my room for much ). My mother seems fine too as of right now just emotionally stressed. I have brought all my belongings to my room so it is easier for me to stay in my room for longer periods of time. Overall, I feel fine. My anxiety and stress levels have definitely gone down and I have attempted on keeping my normal routine just with slight changes because I likely have COVID. Not sure what else needs to be said. As always, stay safe.

Day 3 - April 29th, 2020
Woke up well. Went on with my day the same as yesterday with minor headaches. I'm starting to feel more congested than usual. Felt more tired than usual laid in bed more.

This is about the 6th time I've experienced 'forgetting to breathe'. It's sometimes, but not always accompanied by some form of nightmare. One of the nightmares was being caught under a snow covered awning, being suffocated to death with my arms at my side, unable to clear an airway in the snow.

,COVID19positive,"Asking for my mom who just got a test today. I am positive and she said she’s been feeling sick a few days right after me.

I’m recovered; I’m young and only lost my senses which came back. However, she is diabetic in her 50s. I noticed she seemed like she had a cold the first few days, generally tired and had a mild dry cough. Perhaps day 4-5 she had some nasal congestion. At this time she was still pretty much doing normal things, talking and laughing on the phone etc.

She said her worst was maybe 4 days ago (so perhaps day 10-11) with muscle aches and fatigue. Her face was red and she just looked tired. She didn’t have shortness of breath and could still talk to me fine, but she felt like she had a fever. 

So today close to 2 weeks into symptoms, we got her a test since I was positive and most likely she is. I asked her if she needed to see the online doctor and she said she feels way better. Barely any cough, she said even if she saw the online doctor there’s truly no ongoing symptoms *AT THE MOMENT* she could give him. If anything, she just still feels slightly tired but the muscle aches are not intense. I even bought a pulse oximeter but she is still breathing normally and says it hasn’t been an issue yet. 

I’m being optimistic but still anticipating the worst because I’m not truly sure if it’s gonna get worse even after she feels better today. The test will probably still be positive.

I can’t tell if she’s on the way to recovery since I had the most mild symptoms I’m not too sure how to compare my recovery to hers. Doctor kept telling me if it was VERY severe we’d know by now, since it’s over a week into the illness. I’m just crazy scared tomorrow or the next day things will be different or bad symptoms will return. I never had fatigue but she did so I’m not sure if it’s still considered mild. 

Has anyone genuinely felt like they got very better and then got way worse? What days did you experience the worst symptoms? We’ve been told usually around day 10 you’d know if it was very bad. But my mom is bad at keeping track of her symptoms, and I can’t do plenty to help her bc I’m isolating as well. Only person who doesn’t seem like they have symptoms is my dad which I’m monitoring. I gave it to them, and I only lost my taste and smell. I didn’t have respiratory problems, not even a cough, but I assume it’s bc I’m young and my system battled it off faster. She still has her senses. 



TLDR; Annoying the fuck out of my mom because I’m scared she will need help but she says she feels fine. She felt very fatigue just 3 days ago, face red, etc. Today we got her a test (prob positive) but she says she feels way better and fine. No shortness of breath, constant cough, or major respiratory symptoms seen. Should I be anticipating other major symptoms to come back after “good” days with mild symptoms?

&lt;p&gt;I’m recovered; I’m young and only lost my senses which came back. However, she is diabetic in her 50s. I noticed she seemed like she had a cold the first few days, generally tired and had a mild dry cough. Perhaps day 4-5 she had some nasal congestion.

,COVID19positive,"(edited my original post for more detailed and accurate information about our experience) 

I am 26 years old and my family lives in New York City. My parents live in Staten Island with all my siblings. I live in Brooklyn. 

My mom who is 50 years of age,  got diagnosed with Covid-19 on April 13th after having a fever for 3-5 days. She had bronchitis for a few days after her diagnosis, she is currently and slowly recovering. She never went to the Hospital. We are a family of 6. Mom and dad, 2 daughters in their mid 20's and 2 boy teenagers. My mom was the only one tested. But at the exception of me they all live together in a 3 bedroom apartment. I had visited them when my mom first was feeling a little sick April 4th and 5th.  

She is a stay at home mom so she had hardly gone outside. Turns out my sister brought it home from work. My sister works at a shelter for women that have been through domestic violence. Her superiors failed to inform the staff that one of the residents was in contact with someone that was diagnosed. My sister only had allergy-like symptoms. My sister is 27 years old, she is a celiac and always struggles with allergies of everything and her lungs are often inflamed. She is also being overworked because she is one of the only ones with a car at her place of work. She is recovering from mild symptoms. 

On April 5th, We didn't have a thermometer so I tried my best to check my mom's temperature by touching her face and neck. She was hot but didn't seem to be a full fever. My dad drove me home on Monday morning April 6th.

 By April 8th my mom had a full blown fever and a dry cough. She refused to take more than 2 acetomine a day and resorted for home remedies and eating anti-inflatory and antioxidant. She got tested on April 10th.  April 13th she got a positive diagnosis for Covid-19. 

April 14th, I started to loose my sense of smell and taste. My mom started to have a bronchitis and the rest of the family only had mild symptoms as well. The doctor prescribed my mom some medicine for the symptoms. The whole family always tries to eat healthy but we began to focus on anti-inflammatory and antioxidant foods.  Before diagnosis she took musinex as needed since her Tamiflu prescription wasn't really working. After diagnosed she took her Azithromicine as prescribed. 

I slowly lost my sense of smell April 14th to April 15th and for another 2 days I couldn't taste or smell anything, after that I slowly got my smell and taste back. I did not have any other symptoms, I was not even congested I felt great to be honest. Maybe I slept like 2 more hours each day. Only one day I had a mildly runny nose. Within 7 days I was completely healthy. So by April 21th I was 100%

My 12 year old brother was asymptomatic. The 19 year old had loss of smell and taste but nothing else. My dad had headaches and a little cough. My 27 year olf sister had allergy like symptoms, headaches, and slight lung discomfort. My mom is the only one still recovering as of April 28th. She is maybe 90%. With my sister it is hard to tell because she is always with her allergies 😅

We don't drink, we don't smoke and we try to eat healthy and stay active. My mom has some health issues, arthritis, sometimes low blood pressure and mild depression, in addition she is not very active, as she mostly stays home and doesn't exercise. My sister is a celiac as I stated before and has allergies but she is a runner and excersizes regularly. The rest of us don't have any health problems that we know of. 


I have 2 roommates and they both have not felt any kind of symptoms. They are both in their early 30s.

,COVID19positive,"Just thought I'd share our experience since I know how worrying it is.

Female was smoker until early Feb. One male never smokes, one used to but it was like 10 years ago. 

All three of us are obese af, 2 males 1 female. In our Thirties. 
We work office jobs and don't exercise.  Occasionally we try to eat healthier but its 90% trash. 


It was a shitty couple of weeks. Oxygen was low, everyone was struggling to breathe, and then sick and tired of being sick and tired had us all grumpy.  One of the males finally went to the hospital and got tested (Positive) he was put on oxygen. We're doing alright now, a bit of coughing remains, shortness of breath when exerting but not like it was. 

Our symptoms were similar but different things seemed to happen at different times. 

Female had a runny nose, cough, struggled to breathe, yet oxygen stated over 90, muscle aches and exhaustion fever early on, loss of apatite for a week. late diarrhea near the end

Male 1 had headaches, slight cough, oxygen below 90, no runny nose, lost all taste fever for two weeks straight, loss of appetite for two weeks, early diarrhea 

Male 2 had light cough, oxygen below 90, headaches. sporadic fever, never really lost taste, no loss of appetite, but we all lost the energy to make food really. Digestion is always messed up so not sure on that.

&lt;p&gt;All three of us are obese af, 2 males 1 female. In our Thirties. 
We work office jobs and don&amp;#39;t exercise.  Occasionally we try to eat healthier but its 90% trash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a shitty couple of weeks. Oxygen was low, everyone was struggling to breathe, and then sick and tired of being sick and tired had us all grumpy.  One of the males finally went to the hospital and got tested (Positive) he was put on oxygen. We&amp;#39;re doing alright now, a bit of coughing remains, shortness of breath when exerting but not like it was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our symptoms were similar but different things seemed to happen at different times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female had a runny nose, cough, struggled to breathe, yet oxygen stated over 90, muscle aches and exhaustion fever early on, loss of apatite for a week. late diarrhea near the end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male 1 had headaches, slight cough, oxygen below 90, no runny nose, lost all taste fever for two weeks straight, loss of appetite for two weeks, early diarrhea &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male 2 had light cough, oxygen below 90, headaches. sporadic fever, never really lost taste, no loss of appetite, but we all lost the energy to make food really. Digestion is always messed up so not sure on that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are three weeks in-ish, doing much better. Not perfect but we feel pretty good. 
Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

Hey so my mom is a 911 dispatcher (42F) and tested positive after she lost her smell one day (exactly 2 weeks ago starting tomorrow). She's been in quarantine since then and I never got tested but got a slight start of a cold after she was in quarantine for a few days and then lost my taste and smell a week later. We're on the same floor and it had to stay that way bc my grandfather and everyone else has rooms downstairs. I regained my taste and smell as of now for 6 days maybe as did she, but I've noticed that it's a little bit harder for me to take deep breathes. I got a chest and lung x ray, everything was clear and Ive been taking some prescribed Claritin in case it was an allergic reaction sort of thing. I also have anxiety, but I know what that usually feels like and its never anything related to breathing even when Im super super calm. It got worse when I layed down but after the hospital visit, it eased up some to the point where I could rest at night with no problems. Its still here on a day to day, but Im wondering if this is something anyone else is experiencing. I haven't technically had my full 2 weeks since my mom starting staying home, so Im hoping it'll ease up so I can have normal breathing with already anxiety, and so my anxiousness doesn't make things worse.

My mom experienced the same breathing things too but we just got word that she has bacterial pneumonia and got meds for it. So her case is a bit different because she felt it in a different place (her throat versus me feeling more work in my diaphragm area).

,COVID19positive,"
I’m on week 6, and I realized around week 2-3 when it was the worst for me that my anxiety spiked and caused triggering thoughts. It caused me severe depression when in isolation. Because of the illness, it caused me to be bossy, mean, and unstable which caused a huge strain on my relationship. I called him horrible names and had terrible mood swings for weeks. After a big fight, I moved in with my sister two weeks ago. This caused me to have a panic attack and impulsively bombard his phone with calls and texts which pushed him away even more. Now as of a week ago, my boyfriend isn’t talking to me. This has been so stressful for all of us and I feel I’ve ruined my relationship. My family is worried not only for my physical health, but mostly the mental effects this has caused. I’ve started virtual therapy and have my second session tomorrow. I’m feeling much better physically and mentally, although I’m still on the mend. Even though I’m seeking help and out of the darkness, I feel it’s caused permanent repercussions in my life. I’m left struggling to see what happened and how my mental health declined so quickly.

,COVID19positive,"Hello Covid warriors!

Just a little background: I am not tested positive but i exhibit majority of the mild symptoms. On and off fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, tightness in the chest, fatigue, etc. I’m 8 days in from my first fever. I wasnt tested because when i went to the assessment center, i dont have symptoms that time so my vitals were okay (blood pressure, temperature, oxygen level, no breathing issues, heart rate a bit up but otherwise okay overall). They also said i was young (29F) so i have a good fighting chance. I took it as a good news and went home lol

Anyways, my question is for those with dry cough, how are you guys dealing with it? 
Haven’t been able to sleep well the past few days because i cough and cough and cough all night. Literally no sleep and it makes me feel even more weaker. 

My doctor prescribed me hydrocodone (cough suppressant) and will see if this will work for me tonight. However, i read that it’s not a good idea to suppress the cough because it might prevent my body to expel the virus. 

My plan is to take hydrocodone at night and during the day take mucinex (expectorant) to help thin out the mucus so i can expel it.

He started showing mild symptoms in mid-March and was tested the 3rd of April.

,COVID19positive,"End of feb:  Three days of fever and diarrhea. A dry throat.

Then i have had an ongoing fight with mild symptoms without a fever:


Night sweats, heat flushes, skin feeling hot but no fever. Temp that were elevated but not enough for clinical fever. I had some general fatigue, woke up and had some small coughs. But generally i have not coughed alot. I have just generally felt some sensation far down in the throat/chest that doesnt cause a cough. I was up cooking meals, going for short strolls etc.


I have anxiety issues around health too, and have been isolated alone which i think caused some pain in muscles around neck, in shoulders and even in chest. Body tension and iphone-neck


A few times i have had weird dreams where i didnt get enough air in the dream and i wake up because of it. Never happened before. 


After 4/5 weeks my fatigue became better and most of my symptoms were gone (but not all). i was taking daily walks. Altough i had a lingering sensation, like my lung had some dust in it, like a tickle.
And that sensation has lasted since. 


I have tried to exercise or do some body weightlifting a few times and i noticed it makes me feel shitty after. One time i woke up with a sore throat the day after and some more cough. 



These last days i have had a bad headache and i honestly feel dizzy, like im about to faint. Not strong enough so i will faint. But it DOESNT feel normal. I had an especially long walk today over some hills and when i came home it felt like i was on a ship in a storm, the floor was moving around. 


I have rested and feel alittle less headache but im so fucking tired of feeling strange. I never had a concious shortness of breath etc. and i never had a crazy resting heartrate or a pounding heart. Honestly my symptoms seem very mild but i just cant get healthy in my chest and with my headache etc.

A dry throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then i have had an ongoing fight with mild symptoms without a fever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night sweats, heat flushes, skin feeling hot but no fever. Temp that were elevated but not enough for clinical fever. I had some general fatigue, woke up and had some small coughs. But generally i have not coughed alot. I have just generally felt some sensation far down in the throat/chest that doesnt cause a cough. I was up cooking meals, going for short strolls etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have anxiety issues around health too, and have been isolated alone which i think caused some pain in muscles around neck, in shoulders and even in chest. Body tension and iphone-neck&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few times i have had weird dreams where i didnt get enough air in the dream and i wake up because of it. Never happened before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 4/5 weeks my fatigue became better and most of my symptoms were gone (but not all). i was taking daily walks. Altough i had a lingering sensation, like my lung had some dust in it, like a tickle.
And that sensation has lasted since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to exercise or do some body weightlifting a few times and i noticed it makes me feel shitty after. One time i woke up with a sore throat the day after and some more cough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These last days i have had a bad headache and i honestly feel dizzy, like im about to faint. Not strong enough so i will faint. But it DOESNT feel normal. I had an especially long walk today over some hills and when i came home it felt like i was on a ship in a storm, the floor was moving around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have rested and feel alittle less headache but im so fucking tired of feeling strange. I never had a concious shortness of breath etc. and i never had a crazy resting heartrate or a pounding heart. Honestly my symptoms seem very mild but i just cant get healthy in my chest and with my headache etc. &lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Since lockdown, many of us have a lot more free time on our hands and our minds have become less occupied by the day-to-day, 9-to-5, usual routine. Without the stimulus of our normal routines it becomes very easy to become occupied by the way we feel in our mind and in our bodies. 

This is normal. 

When we become more aware of how we're feeling, we tend to feel more. A typical ache from sitting in a position for too long becomes a pain. When our mind becomes occupied by the fear of ill health, and/or by anxieties about COVID-19, we can start to attribute these feelings to something more than they are. An ache becomes a pain, which becomes myalgia or flu-like symptoms. When we start looking for symptoms, we find them, which fuels our anxiety more.

When this happens, it's important to pause and reflect on what you are feeling any why you are feeling that way. Do you actually have a fever? Or do you feel hot? Many of us will be checking our own temperatures multiple times per day, looking for a justification for our feelings and experiences. This is fine, until it becomes an obsession. The hard part is knowing when you've crossed that line.

Remember, if you have COVID-19, the vast majority of people will have mild or even moderate symptoms that will resolve by themselves at home. Even if you do have a temperature, even if you are experiencing flu-like symptoms, the vast majority of people will have mild or even moderate symptoms that will resolve by themselves at home. 

The only treatment for COVID-19 is paracetamol (for fever), oxygen (if you are hypoxic) and organ support (if you become severely unwell). If you think you need the latter-two, then it's time to see a doctor.

If you are going to be vigilant about your health, be smart. Be worried about symptoms that you are unable to manage at home (i.e. increasing breathlessness, reduced exercise tolerance), seek help when you need it, and if you are worried - see a doctor. 

We are in this for the long-haul. It is a marathon, not a sprint. Looking after your physical and mental health is now more important than ever.

I know she’s positive and to be quite honest I know she sort of blames me for bringing it in the house. The first few days I kept asking if she needed to see the doctor because she’s around 53 and has diabetes so it could be hard for her. 

She kept saying she’s getting better and it seemed like she was. Yesterday she was laughing on the phone, today it sounded like her voice had lots of mucus in when she talks. I hear her dry cough occasionally but it’s not constant. Today, her face seemed redder as well but she says she can breathe okay still, just looks extremely tired. 

She must be on around day 10-12 or so, taking medication (mucinex) and zinc as well. She won’t really respond to me with a straight answer when I ask if she’s getting better or worse...because it’s on and off sometimes now. I don’t know if this is a mild or severe case still. My uncle’s friend tested positive at the hospital, spent his last 2 weeks in ICU and was gone that fast.

I’m holding onto some hope that if she was very severe we would’ve known by now. But realistically I can’t tell if her getting worse today will be downhill from here on out. I feel so incredibly guilty for bringing it home from a patient, even though she warned me to not go to work for a bit. It was too late by the time I asked off.

She won’t really respond to me with a straight answer when I ask if she’s getting better or worse...because it’s on and off sometimes now. I don’t know if this is a mild or severe case still. My uncle’s friend tested positive at the hospital, spent his last 2 weeks in ICU and was gone that fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m holding onto some hope that if she was very severe we would’ve known by now. But realistically I can’t tell if her getting worse today will be downhill from here on out. I feel so incredibly guilty for bringing it home from a patient, even though she warned me to not go to work for a bit. It was too late by the time I asked off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, how are you guys taking care of your family members now? What signs are you looking for? This virus happens so fast and some of our mutual have passed away within weeks at the hospital. I’m incredibly scared for her.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Does anyone get weirdly specific headaches that are only on one part of your head? Hard to describe but it feels like someone is picking at it. The pain isnt as general/as much surface area as a usual headache. I've been getting that today 

I'm a potential false negative. I've been sick since March 12th on and off with sinus issues, recurring sore throat, GI problems, lightheadedness, chest tightness/pressure, a fluid feeling in parts of my lungs and my lymph nodes, body aches, and general malaise. I went to the ER twice because of my shortness of breath, since I could barely talk without feeling out of breath the first week. My chest xray was normal besides a little inflammation, but I did not get a CT scan. Tested negative twice with the nasal swab, but I was told that up to 40% are false negatives and that I should treat it as covid regardless. I just wish I could know for sure.

There were times at night where I was scared of suffocating. My sense of smell was gone at the very beginning. Right now it's not as strong as it used to be, and certain things smell and taste off for lack of a better term.

One day I feel well enough to walk a few miles but the next day I'm wiped out. I was prescribed albuterol and it only helps a tiny bit. I'm also using a nebulizer with saline. I'm on vitamin C, D, zinc, echinacea and some other herbal supplements for my Lyme disease as well. I do have a pulse oximeter and I'm looking at buying a blood pressure cuff too.

My temperature has never gone past 100, usually it sits in the early to mid 99s but right now it's 98. My blood oxygen has been as low as 88 and as high as 99 and seems to change rapidly. I also feel awful after climbing one set of stairs. 

While I'm still better overall, I get a lot of ups and downs. I have also been recently getting kidney pains, and I get dehydrated quickly. It's a bit frustrating when some medical professionals dismiss my symptoms because ""covid only lasts 2 weeks"" or ""you dont have much of a cough"". I used to fly weekly for work up until Mar 6 so there's a high chance I was exposed, and I live in CO where there is community spread as well. I have a weak immune system overall.

I'm hoping for an accurate antibody test that can give me a better idea of where I stand. I've also heard that doesn't necessarily grant you immunity either, so who knows...

Days 3-4: Same minor congestion/fatigue continued on Monday, but now with very subtle muscle aches. These symptoms became slightly more pronounced on Tuesday.

Had a full blown anxiety attack that night about my temperature swings when I went to bed, however I took my temperature and was 97.6. Didn’t get more than 3 hours sleep.

Day 6: woke up feeling wiped out with fatigue and grogginess. I took it easy for the whole day and began to feel gradually better as the day progressed. Temperature throughout the day was between 97.1- 97.5. I was able to get a good nights sleep that night

Day 7: Another good day with minimal symptoms! Was able to get good exercise. When I went to bed however I began feeling slightly nauseous and spent hours trying to feel
comfortable, and as a result was only able to get around 2 hours of sleep. I took my temperature that night and it read 97.3

Day 8: Woke up feeling pretty rough. Fatigue, malaise, and chills. Temperature was still ok at 97.9 all day. I took a long nap from 12:00-4:00 and woke up a little better, still malaise though. I went to bed early and got a good 8.5 hours sleep

Day 9(April 26): woke up completely energized and feeling pretty much 100%. Walked about a mile and spent most of the day positive, wondering if this was nothing at all and had everything to do with my lack of sleep on earlier days. I began getting a sense of dread as the day went on though, and sure enough, around 6:00 I started feeling a little tickle in my throat. I tried clearing it but to no avail. I Started feeling sinus pressure behind my eyes around 8:00 and decided to go to bed at 9:00. As I write this to you now, I am sitting in bed with my head elevated. Now my throat feeling itchy every time I take a deep breath, and when I cough I can feel it in my chest. Temperature read 97.0

I’m pretty anxious about this. Anyone else have symptoms like mine?

&lt;p&gt;Are the two dates too far apart to be covid?&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Hi all,

This is my first time posting here, so I apologise if I am doing anything wrong - please let me know kindly if that is the case.

I have been following the posts on this community for a few days, and I want to thank you all for sharing your experience because it has been such a relief to see I was not alone with these weird symptoms. I decided to create an account to ask you a few precise questions that have been worrying me. Sorry about the long post.

I will start with the questions, so you do not have to read through the whole background if you do not wish to: What is the longest you guys have been ill with Covid symptoms? What has provoked your relapses, in terms of exercise/food/drinks/whatever else, if anything? What symptoms came back for you? Have you had a 'mild' case that somehow worsened after 30+ days of illness leading then to complications, and which type? Have you been tested in one of your relapses and were you then still positive? Have you heard of, or have you yourself, cases in which people got completely better after 30+ days of Covid-19, and how long did it take? 

Summary of my own case: 26F healthy, started March 20 (day 38 now), mostly fever with some breathing problems and chest pains, no coughing - diagnosed by GP but no testing available in my area - relapsing after 48h without fever.

&amp;#x200B;

For a complete background, I have been diagnosed with Covid-19, although they are not testing any 'mild' case here. I am a 26F, relatively healthy (before that anyway), with no diagnosed health problem. I first had a fever and headache on March 21st. It then went on for about a week with sore muscles, extreme tiredness, bad migraines, small throat ache for a week and a fever between 37.5c and 37.9c (my normal temperature averages at 36.5 so that was a big fever for me). 

Then a day without a fever. Then the sore muscles were gone but the respiratory problems started, I had troubles sleeping because I woke up feeling I couldn't breathe well, the fever came back and the fatigue never left. I had this feeling of oppression on my chest, and weird shooting pains in my chest, moving all the time. My breathing was similar to what I can have when I have bad anxiety attacks, but all the time. I also had some scratchy eczema attacks on my face, which I never had before. I finally was allowed to see my GP by Friday 3 April. Walking there (200m, flat ground) I felt like I was climbing a mountain, my breathing was so difficult. The GP then confirmed that it was pretty surely a Covid case, since we're right in a cluster and otherwise there was no explanation. I was supposed to get better by the end of the week and GP kept in touch. By Friday the fever was still there. He prescribed blood tests. 

The week after, while we waited for the results of the blood test, the fever went down and I felt much better. I was able to work a few hours on Thursday afternoon (out of my bed for the first time in a while, sitting at my desk), and on Friday 17 we even celebrated the end of the virus since I had been fever free 48 hours and blood results came back with nothing wrong. Friday evening, fever came back (37.8c). It has been back ever since, quite high (mostly 37.8/37.9), and last two days the fatigue and the sore muscles have been back to, as well as a weird feeling in my throat and some very light difficulties breathing. Went to the GP who is going to call in his contacts to get me tested, because if by some weird coincidence it is not Covid, whatever it is might be darn serious. 

It has reassured me a lot to read that some of you are also on 30+ days of Covid-19 symptoms, officials are saying here that it is supposed to last only a few days and I was getting worried.

&lt;p&gt;I will start with the questions, so you do not have to read through the whole background if you do not wish to: What is the longest you guys have been ill with Covid symptoms? What has provoked your relapses, in terms of exercise/food/drinks/whatever else, if anything? What symptoms came back for you? Have you had a &amp;#39;mild&amp;#39; case that somehow worsened after 30+ days of illness leading then to complications, and which type? Have you been tested in one of your relapses and were you then still positive? Have you heard of, or have you yourself, cases in which people got completely better after 30+ days of Covid-19, and how long did it take? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary of my own case: 26F healthy, started March 20 (day 38 now), mostly fever with some breathing problems and chest pains, no coughing - diagnosed by GP but no testing available in my area - relapsing after 48h without fever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a complete background, I have been diagnosed with Covid-19, although they are not testing any &amp;#39;mild&amp;#39; case here. I am a 26F, relatively healthy (before that anyway), with no diagnosed health problem. I first had a fever and headache on March 21st. It then went on for about a week with sore muscles, extreme tiredness, bad migraines, small throat ache for a week and a fever between 37.5c and 37.9c (my normal temperature averages at 36.5 so that was a big fever for me). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a day without a fever. Then the sore muscles were gone but the respiratory problems started, I had troubles sleeping because I woke up feeling I couldn&amp;#39;t breathe well, the fever came back and the fatigue never left. I had this feeling of oppression on my chest, and weird shooting pains in my chest, moving all the time. My breathing was similar to what I can have when I have bad anxiety attacks, but all the time. I also had some scratchy eczema attacks on my face, which I never had before. I finally was allowed to see my GP by Friday 3 April. Walking there (200m, flat ground) I felt like I was climbing a mountain, my breathing was so difficult. The GP then confirmed that it was pretty surely a Covid case, since we&amp;#39;re right in a cluster and otherwise there was no explanation. I was supposed to get better by the end of the week and GP kept in touch. By Friday the fever was still there. He prescribed blood tests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week after, while we waited for the results of the blood test, the fever went down and I felt much better. I was able to work a few hours on Thursday afternoon (out of my bed for the first time in a while, sitting at my desk), and on Friday 17 we even celebrated the end of the virus since I had been fever free 48 hours and blood results came back with nothing wrong. Friday evening, fever came back (37.8c). It has been back ever since, quite high (mostly 37.8/37.9), and last two days the fatigue and the sore muscles have been back to, as well as a weird feeling in my throat and some very light difficulties breathing. Went to the GP who is going to call in his contacts to get me tested, because if by some weird coincidence it is not Covid, whatever it is might be darn serious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has reassured me a lot to read that some of you are also on 30+ days of Covid-19 symptoms, officials are saying here that it is supposed to last only a few days and I was getting worried. Thank you for reading through.&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"So I was sick with what I think was COVID-19 from March 9. Had at least one previous post about it. It's getting to be a really long story but I'll recount it here. I was tested for COVID once but it was negative on day 27 of symptoms and if I had it (which I'm still leaning toward yes since I never felt this way before, ever), I think I've been dealing with other after-effects. I'd like to get an antibody test once they're available of course. I'm 40F, type A+ blood, no diagnosed comorbidities, normal weight, no hypertension, but have had a lot of crazy medical crap with no answers, probably some autoimmune issues and I suspect I have a mild form of EDS which explains a lot of it.

Basically first 5 days I got a severe autoimmune like flare like I've never had before, even though I get these sometimes. Got really fatigued, severe hip joint pain and lower back pain, and most oddly, these very uncomfortable nerve zinging/tingling sensations in my hands and feet off and on the first 1-2 days. On day 3 I had conjunctivitis. On day 5, I started feeling properly sick, started getting s sore throat and later in the day spiked a fever to 101F. It then rapidly dropped off to 100F, held for the night, and I woke up drenched in sweat with fever broken. The sore throat was also not as bad. Then over the next week, sore throat reworsened and kept coming and going in different areas (lower throat, upper throat, one side of throat only, it was not like any cold I've had before). And an increasingly horrid dry cough/bronchitis and after a few days was using my albuterol inhaler every 4 hours, could only sleep propped up with menthol lozenges wedged in my mouth. I felt suddenly better on day 14 from the start, cough lessened. 

But by day 16 was clear the cough was getting worse again and by day 18-19 I was back on the albuterol and in pure misery again coughing and wheezing non-stop. On day 23, I had a tele-appointment with my PCP and was prescribed azithromycin and a fluticasone (steroid) inhaler, as this sounded like a secondary infection and I was overusing albuterol (didn't work anymore). Started azithromycin that night, steroid inhaler could only be picked up next evening. Had a horrid coughing fit that night before managing to sleep and woke up gasping at 5:30am with mucus like concrete blocking my airway and making it physically hard to breathe, I couldn't clear it. My husband dropped me off at the ER which was fairly useless, O2 sat was 99% so they just made me sit there struggling to breathe for hours and wouldn't do a nebulizer because of COVID, but they did an EKG (normal), lung xray (fairly normal but ""some signs of infection"" whatever that means and told me to continue azithromycin), and finally albuterol administered with a spacer, which cleared the mucus in about 30 mins. Was also told I had low potassium and asked if I had been feeling weak and lightheaded (yes a little but the cough was my entire existence so who knows) and they gave me a dose of potassium and after more hours just sitting there, released me (and refused me a COVID test because they only did them if you were admitted with low O2 sat).

So I continued using albuterol with spacer every 4 hours and it helped a bit for 2 days and stopped really helping. I finally caved and took two doses of fluticasone on day 28, which seemed to help but I have an eye disease for which steroids are strongly counterindicated (doctors still convinced me it was ok but they are not ophthalmologists) and I could see my vision getting worse already, so I stopped cold. I went to an urgent care that day mainly to get a nebulizer prescription. They offered me the COVID test that later came back negative. I never ended up breaking out the nebulizer, started using dextrometorphan before bed and suppress night time coughing attacks and tried to cut back on albuterol and by day 34, finally things took a turn and the cough was suddenly better. I also had severe costochondritis by this point and could barely physically cough anymore.

Ok so now the ""recovery"". Since day 35, and it is now day 48, I've had the rib pain that doesn't seem to go away, it's like an arthritis now just in one rib on the left side - it was on both sides but receded on the right. It hurts badly to cough, sneeze, breathe in deeply. And what's been now more concerning since it is NOT going away, are EBV/herpes virus relapse-like symptoms. I have daily fatigue, lesions in my throat causing a mild sore throat, mildly swollen lymph nodes under my jaw, keep getting continuous rounds of transient lingual papillitis (I normally get 1 or 2 bumps occasionally, and all these symptoms when my immune system is low for whatever reason, but only for a few days not WEEKS), currently have a cold sore, and I'm having night sweats. It started more mild and only my legs were sweating part of the night, but now it's every night all night sweating.

And now I'm reading stuff like this paper indicating this virus damaging the immune system and I'm just wondering what the hell is going on and if anyone else is having latent herpesviruses causing them similar symptoms long after they were first ill? I feel like I have AIDS or something (I don't). Usually after I get over a viral infection, I feel great for at least a week, more energetic than ever. This has been the complete opposite and is actually more like what I get after being exposed to a virus but before getting sick (if ever), only longer duration and feels neverending.

Also the rest of my family had this too but mucb more mild. My 20 mo old daughter was sick at the same time as me (I think we picked it up at a routine pediatrician appt on March 4th in same building/room as urgent care waiting area) but got over it fast, no cough. My husband got it about a week after us and had a sore throat for a week and felt tired, that's it.

I noticed this sound as I was practicing a breathing exercise, I’ve tried to call clinics and urgent cares but as soon as they hear tested positive they say we don’t do that here you have to go to the ER. I can take a normal deep breath hold it for 5 seconds and exhale it without this sound but as you’ll see from the video when I quickly try to take several deep breathes in a row the problem presents itself.

The sound can be felt in my chest like when I cough. I don’t know you all I just don’t want to go back to the ER I have a terrible fear of that place. If anyone can help me or give me some guidance I would be so grateful.

,COVID19positive,"Hi everyone, 

New here; its so nice to find a community that freely shares experiences -- good or bad -- related to this illness. 

I've mentioned in a few posts that my dad is positive and currently in the ICU (extubated now, but still has O2 support). He is an essential worker, who had to continue to work despite shelter-in-place. As with most of you here, esp those who are dealing w/ critical cases in the ICU, this illness is taking a toll on my family's mental health. We are seeking family counselors / therapists via trustworthy sources, but the day-to-day is still incredibly heartbreaking. And more recently, I am really concerned seeing news in the US about certain areas lifting shelter-in-place, not only for obvious public health reasons, but also because people are trying so hard to rush back to normal (and in my head it feels like they want to gloss over all the people / families who cannot just go flip a switch and go back to normal). 

I understand that this doesn't replace an actual mental health counseling service. But I was wondering if any of you have strategies to share to keep your / families' spirits up?

,COVID19positive,"I am 37 yr old female. I got sick March 20th.
My doctor first told me it's just a common cold and gave me a cough medicine.
But I started vomiting. My doctor wasn't available, so a different doctor gave me some pills for nausea.

Then a week later I got sicker. I looked terrible. Every joints in my body was hurting. I was coughing blood up.
My doctor gave me zpak. Nothing happened. I started hearing metal scratching noise from my windpipe every time I blow out a breath. My doctor didn't really believe that. I guess he's never experienced it so he probably didn't know you could hear it yourself.

Anyways, my doctor gave me oral steroids. And by now I had horrible shortness of breath already, so he also gave me an inhaler to use as needed. It didn't really help though.
I thought I was dying. Every inch of my body hurt. I wanted to go to a hospital, but I didn't want to go a place full of covid-19. 

By the end of the second week, my doctor discussed with some other doctors at his practice, and decided to send me to get tested. I went the next day, it was positive. I was sent for an xray the day after. I had pneumonia.
I wanted to die. Everything was painful. And knowing that there's no cure made the pain worse. I started thinking about death in more detail. I contacted a local medical school which I had arranged to donate my body after I'm gone, and told them I have covid. They said they couldn't except my body anymore. That was very depressing. 

On the third week, my doctor said ""you have pneumonia. What do you think? Do you want another rounds of antibiotics?"" I sensed the uncertainty from his voice. But I had no other choice just like he didn't have any other option. So I said sure.
He gave me a different kind of antibiotics this time, and the oral steroids again. And he also gave me a steroid inhaler to use twice a day. He tried to send me to the ER once, but the ambulance came to my house to tell me the hospitals are full. By the end of the 3rd week, I didn't get better at all. And my doctor admitted he didn't know what to do anymore. He called a pulmonologist onto my case.

This lung doctor didn't know shit either, obviously. But now they were discussing with more doctors and finally decided to give me hydroxychloroquine which he told me before that it was only for inpatients at the hospitals. My doc also gave me clonazepam to let me calm, but very low dose because apparently I could stop functioning.
The lung doctor told me to sleep with my head higher than the heart. And also on my stomach. 🙄 So....... I just ignored it.

Another week passed.

And now I have an oxygen concentrator a home the pulmonologist prescribed. I'm on it 24 hours. They also gave me the oxygen tanks to use when I go outside, but I'm like, outside? Hello I'm being quarantined.

My doctor told me they will test me for the antibody in 2-3 weeks. Then they will know if I still have either active coronavirus or the antibody. That's when he will tell me if I could step outside of the house or not.

This has been hard especially because my husband was still going to work when I was in the most pain, and I had to care for our baby. Then he also became positive. Although he was sick only for 2 weeks, it was a hell trying to look after the 11 month old baby while we both have a very contagious, possibly deadly virus.

Luckily the baby never got sick, and it's going to be his first birthday on 30th.
My husband is back to work so it will be me and the baby. We are not allowed invite anyone into this house. So yup. At least he's so young that he won't remember it, right? 

I still have some breathing difficulties and coughing from the pneumonia, but no more body aches, no more night sweat, no more chills. Well, headache still comes and goes. 

The pulmonologist thinks I will be on this oxygen machine for at least a month, and she predicted that it will take about 2-3 months until I completely recover like before I got sick.

,COVID19positive,"So how do you know when you're on the way out?

I have been battling a respiratory infection since March. I have been unable to get tested because they are not doing any general tests.

Started off as a dry cough and quickly turned into a productive one. Within 2 weeks I was wheezing and having chest pains. 

Went to the doctor where they didn't do any tests and prescribed me steroids. Well that didn't work and my symptoms were just as bad, spitting up phlegm, fatigue and chest pains - although no fever.

Around week four I try to go see the doctor again, but they are not seeing any patients with respiratory symptoms. I end up having 10 days of antibiotics given to me which reduces the phlegm in a big way. 

Now on like week five and a week after the antibiotics I'm getting bouts of chest tightness and some lingering pangs in my left lung it seems. Doc said over the phone that it's my small airways that are clogged and gave me a puffer although I have reacted bad with that (rapid heart rate, weekness)

My lord, I have never had an illness that has taken so much out of me for so long. For as 27 year old dude that likes fitness this put my world on hold. Don't know if I should be demanding an xray or riding it out. Hard when clinics don't even want to see you...

Not tested but assumed i have it as i show majority of symptoms. Mild cases aren’t tested in my area. Called my doctor and said i should self-isolate. 

Im on my Day 6 since my first symptom. Started with (in order) stuffy nose, sore throat, mild cough, fever, pressure in the chest and difficulty breathing then on and off fever with muscle and joint pain and bad dry cough since day 4. 

Above symptoms are somehow manageable except my dry cough. I literally cannot sleep and it contributes to my difficulty in breathing. 

Anyone here has some good advise on how to handle it?

I tried taking Tylenol (when i had a fever) with cough suppressant but it didn’t work. Also tried cough syrup but to no avail. Lozenges work for a minute but cough turns back on.

,COVID19positive,"43 year old male.  I tested positive today.  Now that tests are more plentiful, I finally decided to see if I had it.  I'm now in my 5th week since this all began.  I feel much much better.  Just minor lingering symptoms remain at random times.  It's been very odd.  On and off symptoms at varying degrees of intensity.  Here are my symptoms below:

It started in early March with back pain.  Fairly bad back pain with what felt like tingling electrical pulses.  Mid back to left of spine.  It made my limbs feel weak.  At one point, while sitting on the couch, I got up and fell to the floor.  My leg fell asleep without the trademark tingling or feel you are used to.  No warning..leg was dead and down I went.  I was concerned and figured I'd monitor things.  

After a few days of the back pain, it slowly lessened and I began to get a horrible headache.  All on the left side of my head.  It made me want to vomit.  This headache lasted 3 days.  I had no other symptoms at this time

Around week into this, I began to feel overwhelming fatigue.  So, at this point, no back pain, no headache.  Just fatigue.  It seems I get one symptom at a time to deal with..at high intensity.  

The fatigue lasted a couple weeks...in during the time, I began to feel intermittent shortness of breath.  No cough.  No fever.  Just fatigue and trouble breathing.

During the 3re week, I finally developed a fever.  Very low grade.  It never hit 100.  I felt very hot, but the thermometer never went as high as I felt.  The fatigue lasted throughout and in also got nausea and stomach pain.

During the last two weeks, daily, I may feel a brief fever, i may get a headache, I may feel shortness of breath...may also feel fine.  Thing come and go.  Weak and strong.  It doesnt make much sense.  But, today the test revealed this was all covid-19.  I assume this is what they call a mild case.  Its was worse than any flu, but I'm happy I was not crushed with multiple symptoms all at once the whole time.  The virus picked and chose what I would receive at different times.

I am experiencing BAD insomnia. My mind isnt shutting off, I cannot sleep my body needs to be dead tired to even sleep for 1-2 hours a day. I suffer from sleep apnea as well. I keep overthinking and I cant sleep at all. I think ive only gotten about 7-8 hours of sleep this past week

Its been a week, my sense of taste and smell is back but its hard for me to breathe. I randomly get attacks of severe shortness of breath in the morning at the same time for the past 3 days. I drink alot of water, eat foods with Vitamin C and try to rest after. Ive also been experiencing bad insomnia and havent slept properly since ive gotten tested.

,COVID19positive,"Greetings COVID-fighters!

My wife and I (35 and 39 years old) are both sick with the same symptoms and are presumed positive by doctors. First 3 weeks, we had a crazy amount of weird symptoms (body aches, bad stomach, strange dreams, extreme fatigue, fever-feelings, sore throat, breast pain, shortness of breath, discomfort feelings, brain fog), symptoms coming in waves on&amp;off. The worse sickness feels started to wear off around two weeks ago. Still, it seems like the ""shortness of breath"" (headaches, heart racing some days) and feeling generally bad after physical activity is not getting any better. It's impossible to live a normal life in our current situation.

We did accept this is taking a long time to heal, even if it's tough to accept the sudden handicap, both being very healthy and very active normally.

However! I would love to hear or see at least ONE ""light in the tunnel"" story about getting back to a healthy life after this. I don't think I have seen one story about being sick with COVID-19 + shortness of breath, for 30 days+ and getting 100% healthy. Let me know if there is a story like this out there, or you got something positive to share with us!

,COVID19positive,"Bit of background - have previously worked within the healthcare sector and have entry-level medical knowledge and training. I was around for SERS/MERS and 2016 was a strange flu season in the UK. Some clinicians I worked with was convinced that, that year there was some strange flu-like infection which was being treated as Influenza. We had quite a lot of deaths from Influenza and I personally dealt with people who had serious complications due to flu. Not only this, but Sepsis was massively on the rise in 2016 and if you ask any medical professional, Sepsis can kind of be seen as an umbrella term for a collection of symptoms, which more often than not, result in the same medical outcome.

I remember attending a training day on it where two clinicians actually got into an argument over sepsis - one stated that it could be tested for, another said it couldn't. One cited that many sepsis cases had been misdiagnosed as flu, and vice versa - the other argued that CRP was basically a signpost, whilst the other said this could be attributed to conditions resulting from the flu also. It was a weird time in 2016 and I was very scared for patients who presented with symptoms of either. One colleague (who I didn't know personally), hung herself on her break because she 'misdiagnosed' sepsis in a toddler who eventually died of kidney failure.

I have previous contracted Swine Flu in 2009 and was one of 200 or so students who contracted H1N1 symptoms within the campus - I isolated for seven days and was prescribed Tamiflu. I had no test, but after an over-the-phone consultation (where the clinician listened to my cough oddly), I was diagnosed as our campus had an outbreak.

Before this, I had been hospitalised in 2005ish with a mystery illness, which at the time, was the worst unexplained illness I had ever had. I felt like I was 'stroking' and had the worst body pains ever - my head felt like it was about to explode and I was groggy, felt drunk at times, photosensitivity, had a niggly cough (but no ARDS) and my lungs felt like they were full of concrete. The doctors couldn't diagnose me, but after day 8 in an isolation room, I was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, which I suspected (at the time), I had caught in the hospital. It just came on me, a dryish cough which came and went - which I felt I could control - but would come when I began to talk; this is how I was diagnosed with pneumonia; my ex gf's mother (who weirdly recently had symptoms of COVID after returning from Tenerife in March and was hospitalised but test negative despite medics convinced she had it) had a friend who was fighting MRSA - she noticed my cough and told the doctors, who then investigated. I was discharged on day 10 with a load of anti-biotics and my lungs never felt the same after that.

My parents were advised against vaccinating me as a child due to serious eczema and allergies; after my mother explained this to the school nurse, I never heard anything more. More recently (2015), I was doing volunteer work as a research and development administrator within a women's hospital for drug trails. Therefore, needed an MMR jab - I received the jab, not even thinking of my childhood and about 10 minutes after the jab, my face became red, I started to profusely sweat, felt a sudden onset of fever and nigh-on collapsed in the chair. Thing is, I was in a room with six nurses who all knew I'd had the jab and each clamoured around me to attend. I went white as a sheet and I started getting a sore neck right there and then - it was odd, very odd. I was sent home and was off work... I received a call to say that I should 'take some time off' - I never went back.

Vis-a-vis, I have had a history with viruses and illness and can remember each flu/cold I've had and I think we are all in agreement that no two flus are really the same. Some are milder, some are tougher and whilst it may very well depend on your physiology at the time; who here hasn't had one 'mild' flu, only to be knocked down with another they've caught from a loved one, who simply shrugged it off. The word 'man-flu' is often bandied about in some countries - I think this word may go out of style after Covid-19.

With all the above in mind, without knowing how other people are affected by viruses, I do believe that I am somewhat susceptible to viruses and perhaps that is due to my lifestyle - but I do think that whilst my immune system is possibly shot for some reason (I have had hyperhidrosis since my late teens), I usually am quite okay at fighting off infections.... eventually.

Fast forward to 2020 and this is bizarre that I've stumbled on this here thread. I have had, either three different infections/viruses/colds or I've had a virus that has cleared up, come back, cleared up and come back. I am a student (again) and studied at a pretty large metropolitan international university, and this is going to sound weird, but in class in early December, I brought up how strange it was that so many people were sick or ill within the city. It wasn't just me who noticed it - others had mentioned that the university seemed run down, and you couldn't go anywhere within the city without seeing someone coughing, sneezing or blowing their nose. I have no doubt that this is purely coincidence, but I distinctly remember seeing a guy on my bus in early December sometime who was leaned against a window and literally looked like someone out of of a contagion film. I asked him if he was okay as I got off, he just nodded at me and I carried on.

I had started a new 'relationship' in January with a long-term girlfriend who had recently returned from working for six months on the cruise ships. We went to a local arcade and pub on a first date in February (see below) and in the arcade, we noticed quite a few folks with face masks on - we made a joke about it at first, but then she got speaking about how her ship was struck down with an illness in September/October 2019 and the ship's doctor had said it was flu. She said she'd never been so sick and spent 10 days in her cabin with her workmate, both with flu-like symptoms.

Her parent works within the lead shop of an international renown soccer club and she came down with the flu of some sort in December which 'knocked the stuffing out of her', and her sister (who works in the same ward as a clinician who recently died of Covid-19).",t2_sxqhq,False,,0,False,"Untested - had early Coronavirus symptoms; 'over it', but...

I was around for SERS/MERS and 2016 was a strange flu season in the UK. Some clinicians I worked with was convinced that, that year there was some strange flu-like infection which was being treated as Influenza. We had quite a lot of deaths from Influenza and I personally dealt with people who had serious complications due to flu. Not only this, but Sepsis was massively on the rise in 2016 and if you ask any medical professional, Sepsis can kind of be seen as an umbrella term for a collection of symptoms, which more often than not, result in the same medical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember attending a training day on it where two clinicians actually got into an argument over sepsis - one stated that it could be tested for, another said it couldn&amp;#39;t. One cited that many sepsis cases had been misdiagnosed as flu, and vice versa - the other argued that CRP was basically a signpost, whilst the other said this could be attributed to conditions resulting from the flu also. It was a weird time in 2016 and I was very scared for patients who presented with symptoms of either. One colleague (who I didn&amp;#39;t know personally), hung herself on her break because she &amp;#39;misdiagnosed&amp;#39; sepsis in a toddler who eventually died of kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have previous contracted Swine Flu in 2009 and was one of 200 or so students who contracted H1N1 symptoms within the campus - I isolated for seven days and was prescribed Tamiflu. I had no test, but after an over-the-phone consultation (where the clinician listened to my cough oddly), I was diagnosed as our campus had an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this, I had been hospitalised in 2005ish with a mystery illness, which at the time, was the worst unexplained illness I had ever had. I felt like I was &amp;#39;stroking&amp;#39; and had the worst body pains ever - my head felt like it was about to explode and I was groggy, felt drunk at times, photosensitivity, had a niggly cough (but no ARDS) and my lungs felt like they were full of concrete. The doctors couldn&amp;#39;t diagnose me, but after day 8 in an isolation room, I was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, which I suspected (at the time), I had caught in the hospital. It just came on me, a dryish cough which came and went - which I felt I could control - but would come when I began to talk; this is how I was diagnosed with pneumonia; my ex gf&amp;#39;s mother (who weirdly recently had symptoms of COVID after returning from Tenerife in March and was hospitalised but test negative despite medics convinced she had it) had a friend who was fighting MRSA - she noticed my cough and told the doctors, who then investigated. I was discharged on day 10 with a load of anti-biotics and my lungs never felt the same after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents were advised against vaccinating me as a child due to serious eczema and allergies; after my mother explained this to the school nurse, I never heard anything more. More recently (2015), I was doing volunteer work as a research and development administrator within a women&amp;#39;s hospital for drug trails. Therefore, needed an MMR jab - I received the jab, not even thinking of my childhood and about 10 minutes after the jab, my face became red, I started to profusely sweat, felt a sudden onset of fever and nigh-on collapsed in the chair. Thing is, I was in a room with six nurses who all knew I&amp;#39;d had the jab and each clamoured around me to attend. I went white as a sheet and I started getting a sore neck right there and then - it was odd, very odd. I was sent home and was off work... I received a call to say that I should &amp;#39;take some time off&amp;#39; - I never went back.&lt;/p&gt;

This guy's been following COVID since the beginning, and is a real independent researcher who used to work at UC Davis.  https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6ZmR8DsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en

For the last month or so, he has been talking about a bacterial connection to COVID.  There's a lot to read from his preprints, twitter, and wordpress, so I'm not going to get technical, I haven't read it all myself.  A few things that possibly support this hypothesis:

- during my phases of illness, I will have **TERRIBLE** breath.  Not just bad breath, but breath that **smells like straight up feces.**  Anyone with experience in fermentation or composting will tell you that anaerobic bacteria smell like absolute shit.  

- Additionally, doctors are on record saying that many patients die of sepsis.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis#Definitions
According to this, I have already experienced sepsis during COVID.  Very fast heartrate and chills, during an infectious process, and I had **almost no urine output** (despite drinking 7 glasses a day), and probably elevated lactate since my muscles were aching.  30% of sepsis cases have bacteria in the blood.

- Another thing is that during ill phases, my symptoms experience tremendous relief after a bowel movement.  These bowel movements are not normal.  They are slightly floaty and diarrhoeic, and in small pebbles, never big solid stools.  Also have a slight reddish color.  The fact that stomach upset is a main symptom at all seems to increase suspicion further.  

- To be specific:  I will wake up with a very fast heartbeat, just feeling generally extremely sick.  Then I'll go to the bathroom, dump my diarrhea, and feel immediately better and calmer.  The thing is, this isn't the first time it's happened--this has happened to me for a few straight days back in **2010, when COVID didn't exist.**  

- Low/No viral loads.  I've tested negative twice.  I still have a textbook description of COVID.  Many others have too.  Sandeep Chakraborty refers to one case where they were tested negative **8 times in a row** before testing positive.

,COVID19positive,"Hi! so I think I had covid around the end of February. I went to Disney, and five days later I woke up with a dry cough that felt like someone was sitting on my chest. By the end of the day I had a fever, chills, and aches. The fever went away after the first day, but every now and again I would get aches and chills throughout the two weeks that I had it. The cough though my god, it was like razor blades were in my lungs. I couldn't talk, and a one point I had a cough/breathing that was very crackly. I did tela-doc, and they told me it could of been an upper respiratory infection/cold and bronchitis. I also had shortness of breath. My mother ended up getting it as well, and she had a fever for two days, and was fatigued for a week or so straight. 

However, I never had a sore throat during my two weeks ordeal, and my nose wasnt stuffy to the extent it normally is with a cold.

I went to Disney, and five days later I woke up with a dry cough that felt like someone was sitting on my chest. By the end of the day I had a fever, chills, and aches. The fever went away after the first day, but every now and again I would get aches and chills throughout the two weeks that I had it. The cough though my god, it was like razor blades were in my lungs. I couldn&amp;#39;t talk, and a one point I had a cough/breathing that was very crackly. I did tela-doc, and they told me it could of been an upper respiratory infection/cold and bronchitis. I also had shortness of breath. My mother ended up getting it as well, and she had a fever for two days, and was fatigued for a week or so straight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I never had a sore throat during my two weeks ordeal, and my nose wasnt stuffy to the extent it normally is with a cold. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking I already had it, but with some of the accounts I&amp;#39;ve been reading where people have had it for a month or so straight (and these are mild cases) or it ends up being much more severe in my case.

Most people are infected with the chronic Epstein Barr virus. However, it becomes more activated in some people and leads to autoimmune issues/fatigue etc. It may be that some have a higher viral load of it because the conditions in their body allow for a faster viral replication. The paper I linked shows that many of the Covid patients this team tested in China also had acute (not latent) Epstein Barr, especially if a fever was present. 

Furthermore, some of the weird Covid symptoms like rashes, tingles and swollen glands are also symptoms of Epstein Barr.

I am not a scientist nor am I a medical professional. I’m just Covid positive going on week 6 and digging for answers. I thought this could be a potential relationship that might interest some people on here and warrant further investigation.

The ACE-2 receptors are distributed around the body but most either get it in the lungs or the colon - some the blood and the heart's ACE-2 can get infected.

In the colon these cells with the ACE-2 receptors also explode too but its more like a (sheet-storm) since if we reabsorb the exploded cell contents from the colon it gets into the blood and if enough can cause inflamation and fevers.

,COVID19positive,"I’m mostly posting this for documentation, especially since I started off with extremely mild symptoms. Also just so there’s more info out there!

Symptoms started April 13/14, tested April 18 and today got positive results. 

Started as a dry cough, headaches,sore throat, and burning sensation in chest. Some trouble breathing but chalked it up to anxiety. Light heart palpitations.

Progressed to less coughing and less dry throat. Can still feel some discomfort when I inhale deeply, like a sore throat but in my chest. One day with low grade fever and occasionally getting night sweats. 

My biggest issue now is I’ve been extremely nauseous! For about 3 days now. I also can barely taste anything.

Overall very mild case. About my health: 25, asthmatic, non smoker, slightly overweight.

What I’ve been treating symptoms with: Smokers tea, ginger tea, Mucinex(suppressant), lots of vitamins and probiotics, humidifier, coconut water, aspirin for heart and pain.

I prepped really hard for this because of my asthma and because a relative ended up with covid related pneumonia, so that may have helped keep my symptoms mild?

,COVID19positive,"Hey all, I just stumbled upon this page and was curious if anyone here got COVID-19 after visiting Park City UT or Copper Mountain/Vail area the end of February/early March. I got pretty damn sick after a recent visit.. 

Here’s my story if anyone is curious. 

Me: 28/M, pretty fit, with no pre-existing conditions.

I had two weeks off work and took a couple ski trips to Park City, UT from Feb 20-24 and then Copper Mountain, CO from 2/28 - 3/1. On my last day at Copper, I woke up with what I thought was a hangover (we were drinking in the hot tub heavily the night before) but didn’t really kick it like I normally would after having breakfast and taking an Advil.

Aside from the hangover, I noticed dryness in my throat and some soreness in my lower back but shook it off and went skiing anyway. While I was skiing I developed a nasty dry cough, and by the time I got back I was chilled to the bone and fatigued. I had even worse aches in my lower back and came down with horrible shivers and wrapped myself up in a blanket, which didn’t help much.

I ended up leaving that night sick as a dog and by the time I was halfway back to Denver (where I live) my fever spiked and the chills got even worse. I made it home and passed out almost immediately. Overnight I broke my fever at least twice and woke up with my bed and clothes completely soaked.

The next day (Monday, 3/2) I coincidentally had an appointment with my MD for a routine check-up, and let them know ahead a time I had flu-like symptoms.

I got pretty damn sick after a recent visit.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my story if anyone is curious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: 28/M, pretty fit, with no pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had two weeks off work and took a couple ski trips to Park City, UT from Feb 20-24 and then Copper Mountain, CO from 2/28 - 3/1. On my last day at Copper, I woke up with what I thought was a hangover (we were drinking in the hot tub heavily the night before) but didn’t really kick it like I normally would after having breakfast and taking an Advil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the hangover, I noticed dryness in my throat and some soreness in my lower back but shook it off and went skiing anyway. While I was skiing I developed a nasty dry cough, and by the time I got back I was chilled to the bone and fatigued. I had even worse aches in my lower back and came down with horrible shivers and wrapped myself up in a blanket, which didn’t help much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up leaving that night sick as a dog and by the time I was halfway back to Denver (where I live) my fever spiked and the chills got even worse. I made it home and passed out almost immediately. Overnight I broke my fever at least twice and woke up with my bed and clothes completely soaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day (Monday, 3/2) I coincidentally had an appointment with my MD for a routine check-up, and let them know ahead a time I had flu-like symptoms. I got there, was immediately masked and checked out. They did not have any COVID-19 tests at the time but did test me for the flu. Negative. I also had a flu shot earlier in the season as well. I was diagnosed with bronchitis unspecified type and sent home with an Rx for a Z Pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next 4 days my dry cough got even worse, back aches continued, carried a low grade fever (~99.8) during the day, came down with GI issues and lost my appetite. My fevers at night shot up close to 103 and my bed was routinely soaked each morning. There were times I would cough so much I could barely breathe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started feeling a bit more normal by Friday, but the cough and GI issues persisted for about three more weeks. I also got these weird sores on my toes toward the end of March that are now finally starting to heal up. &lt;/p&gt;

1. I quickly went from energetic to lethargic and feverish on my last night in Colorado. Over the course of a few hours, I started feeling very sick, like a really bad cold or flu was coming upon me.
2. That first night was awful. The weirdest dreams of my life and constant up and down to urinate. Chills in bed.
3. I woke with a sore throat and fever. I took Ibuprofen to reduce the fever in the morning, but by afternoon I was shivering again, and took more Ibuprofen. After flying across the country, I landed and the sinus pressure was terrible. For days, I would have sinus pressure and terribly clogged sinuses. I have not had sinus issues that bad for many, many years.
4. I developed a really bad cough, quite painful at times. At times there was mild chest pain and shortness of breath, but I didn't struggle to breath.
5. The fever wasn't as bad as the first night and second day, but persisted as a low-grade fever for a number of days.
6. I had some weird pain in my lower legs.
7. The cough took a number of days to resolve.

&lt;p&gt;Slept a little better last night. Cough has started this morning. Very tired and weak. Occasional cough. One fever 100.3 with chills. Back aches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 7, 4/19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Severe body aches. Fevers overnight. Insomnia. Cough. Lungs feel like they are burning if I take a deep breath. Fever in afternoon. Worst day yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 8, 4/20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Very miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 9, 4/21&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even worse. Doctor sent me to the ER. Antiemetics ineffective. Vomiting all day. Fever 101. Can&amp;#39;t rest, or lay down due to cough. (Later found out that I had a reaction to the Reglan called akathisia... This was hell. Severe panic attacks.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 10, 4/22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10% better than my worst day. Was able to eat one piece of toast. Drank some tea.  Still very sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 11, 4/23&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling queasy and tired, but able to move around the house a little. Ate a bagel. Diarrhea 15-20 times today. Dr said to try Imodium. Says to be out of work for one more week. Still feeling very weak and unable to eat much. No fever. No vomiting. My period came 6 days early, presumably due to the stress on my body. &lt;/p&gt;

There are millions of people experiencing **multi-month COVID.**  The reason is unclear.  Just to clarify, I myself have tested negative twice.  However, viral load is highest before the onset of symptoms, and I got tested 2 weeks in.  (and again 4 weeks in)

I see two possible reasons:  

**1)**  The virus is like HIV.  Your body is incapable of eliminating it, and after your inflammatory immune response, it stays hidden within the recesses of your body.  You feel good after this, and as you go back to normal, the virus repopulates again.  

**2)**  The disease is autoimmune.  You actually recover from the virus in 2 weeks.  However, some people have a ""hyperfocusing"" immune system with a strong ""memory"".  In these people, the immune system can't let go of the insanely strong response it mounted, so it continues to respond even after the threat is gone.

,COVID19positive,"Hi all,

I am a 28 year old female from the USA. No pre-existing health conditions, in shape, eat healthy, good BMI etc. 

I was diagnosed COVID-Positive on the 23rd of March. Tomorrow it will be an entire month.  This is my 4th and perhaps worst wave of symptoms. 

After struggling on and off for weeks at home, I was admitted to the hospital. I was vomiting uncontrollably, running a 95.9-96.0 degree temp (TOO low), struggling to breathe on my own and had severe sweats and violent chills. Turns out my pulse oxygen was very low which they helped with right away. They also ran another slew of tests. 

After my chest X-ray, EKG and CT of chest—the doctors came in to let me know that my pulmonary artery was extremely dilated (the doc said he usually sees this in people in their 70s and 80s). They are unsure if the damage to my lungs from COVID has affected my heart and arteries. They did notice that my lung function was back to normal but some abnormal spots on my lungs perhaps left behind by COVID.

I was also retested via nasal swab to see if there were still traces of Covid in my system after a month of continuous symptoms. Waiting on all of the results now and I am very nervous and concerned. Has anyone had anything that has gone on this long? Anyone dealing with potential heart damage? 

Thanks for reading. Be well.


ETA: I have been discharged from the hospital after my 2nd consecutive negative COVID-19 test. 

My echocardiogram shows that I have developed Pulmonary Hypertension due to my lungs and heart working so hard to kick this virus.

,COVID19positive,"A lot of people have been asking me what I've been feeling and I've been wanted to tell others what this illness reminds me of but I've been hesitant to say.

But 17 days out, I'm going come out and say that I struggled with and opioid addiction years back. I was abusing a drug called Opana or oxymorphone (different than oxycodone) and I don't know if the drug is even prescribed anymore.

I cold turkey'd Opana because my doctor refused to continue prescribing it. I did not go to any detox center and decided to white knuckle it at home.

I'll never forgot how sick I felt for the first 10 or so days.

**The Similarities:**

- The pain was intense. I would constantly have to take hot showers and even epsom salt baths. After a few days, it lessened but no matter the lack of energy, I had to take hot showers and ibuprofen. This checks out with COVID 19 except I'm taking paracetamol instead of ibuprofen. In both cases, the pain made it really difficult to sleep. There was no such thing as a ""comfortable position"".

- The hot and cold sweats were intense and extremely uncomfortable. Same with COVID 19. I never checked my temperature while I was going through withdrawal but the it felt the same as COVID 19. The room is too hot, you put a fan on you, it's too cold. This also happened mostly at night when you're trying to sleep making it very difficult to actually fall asleep.

- In both cases, sleep is downright strange. I remember not being able to describe the dreams during Opana withdrawal. Sometimes just scrambled words, terrifying, and I'd wake up, try to find a comfortable position and try to drift back to sleep. In the 17 day after testing positive, there have been times when I couldn't get back to sleep. My doctor treating me via telehealth gave me the OK to take benadryl to fall asleep and it's helped.

- There were days when I felt pretty ok. With Covid 19, the pain subsided after some pretty rough days and I thought it was over. It wasn't. Symptoms have gone and came back and that feels very discouraging. 

- My lack of energy, motivation, interest and overall depression. Sometimes when I can't sleep, I'll try to watch something on Netflix but it's basically background noise. You pay attention the plot for 5 minutes and then lose it. This was so similar to my opioid withdrawal. I am predisposed to depression, however, I was doing well before being infected. 

In addition to that, self-quarantining is difficult because my mother would help me during withdrawal, but I'm completely alone of course. None of my other family were infected. It's a lonely experience.

- Not eating or wanting to eat. This was consistent with opioid withdrawal except for one thing, opioid withdrawal gave me the runs whether I ate or not, and with COVID 19, I haven't experienced any noticeable GI issues.

I'm not hungry, I have no interest in eating, and my sense of smell and taste are no longer completely gone, but still not as strong as they were before. I still force myself to eat but not having the runs is a major plus because I haven't had to worry about dehydration.

- Impending sense of doom. So this may go along with the depression and losing motivation and being depressed but there is a certain feeling and you would have had to feel it before to understand it. It really hit me hard with opiod withdrawal, but it's definitely here and there with COVID 19. It's a strange sensation to experience, it's not something you want to experience, but in those moments, everything just feels dark, everything is meaningless, you think about your friends and family, your dreams and aspirations, and everything prior to this just feels grim and that's the best way I can describe this feeling. It's fleeting but still there, moreso now at day 17 than in the beginning.

**What is different:**

- As I mentioned, I had the runs with opioid withdrawal. This would be sooo much suckier if I had to worry about dehydration during this. I still make sure I'm hydrated of course.

- There's no ""craving"" for anything. There were days where I'd think it would be nice to have a painkiller right now, but I know it would complicate the matters. The pain isn't serious enough for a relapse, it just sucks. Hot showers and epsom salt baths AND MY HEATING PAD have been godsends.

- There weren't any respiratory problems with opiod withdrawal. My breathing is stable right now, but there was a point where I couldn't walk down the hall without feeling winded and that's when I realized I needed to get tested. I have to do a certain breathing exercise (not deep breathing) that requires me to lie on my stomach.

- Oh yeah, I didn't have to lie on my stomach for opioid withdrawal. This was suggested in the first days. I could lie on my side when I slept but was advised to lie on my stomach when relaxing.

I don't know if this helps anyone. My case was considered mild. I use a pulsometer to make sure my oxygen levels are normal and I'm doing much better. I'm in contact with my doctor and I've avoided reading others experiences. I always found that it could make symptoms worse, or make symptoms I didn't have suddenly ""happen"".

The last 3 days, I haven't had a fever and that ""technically"" means I'm ready to be tested again, and the virus should no longer be in my body but my doctor advised an additional 2 weeks of self-quarantining because of the lingering symptoms.

I think there will be an end when I'm fully recovered but for a case that's been considered mild, it's been a tough time. I know opioid withdrawal has NOTHING to do with Covid-19, but it was the closest experience I could compare it to. I've had the common cold, influenza, strep throat, but I have to say that this has been the hardest for me.

But if anyone watched Chris Cuomo on CNN when he was kind of documenting his experience, he kept saying how lucky he felt. Not really a fan of Chris Cuomo but he was right about certain things. This isn't the flu, nights (or whenever you can get to sleep) are when it's the worst, and I do feel lucky because maybe this could have killed me if I didn't act sooner. I was the only in my family was infected, I'm praying I didn't infect anyone else.

**DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AND STILL GOT THE VIRUS:**

I was isolating since March. I GET that I'm in NY but I took this incredibly seriously from the get go. I live alone with my cats in an apartment building, I didn't touch rails, I sanitized after touching door knobs or anything outside (while taking the garbage out or getting the mail), I used a grocery DELIVERY service where they bought the bags to my door without any contact. I wiped down EVERYTHING including my mail. I door-dashed with no contact (they give you the option). Wiped everything down just incase.

**Where I could have gone wrong:**

Walmart - I used a service called RXpay hoping they would bring my medication to me in my car and they could just scan my phone. In fact, the pharmacist told me I could do this. NOPE! I get there and they tell me I have to come pay inside. They couldn't bring the scanner outside. I was somewhat prepared but not with a proper mask. Let me tell you something, this April 4th, and couples and families were still going in together. This was right after our governor said you had to wear a some sort of face covering in public. I'd say half weren't. Social distancing? There was a lady at the entrance offering sanitized carts, GREAT! What wasn't great is that the lady was holding up a line of people who weren't respecting personal space or the markers on the ground that marked 6 feet. I go in with sunglasses, and a scarf, I'm on this ridiculous line and the guy in front of me turns around and yells to his girlfriend outside, ""WE DON'T NEED A CART! ... A CART!"" Jesus f'ing Christ. 

The guy yelled right into my face. Of course he didn't have a mask. I finally get in, the pharmacy seems to have things in check, they have a visor and everything, they scanned my phone, handed me my meds and I was out of there. But Walmart decided to put these stupid automatic gates that you could only enter through and stupid me, I'm trying to get out of the store ASAP, and I'm literally having a panic attack and walk up to the gate where you can't leave. I don't know Walmart's new layout, I don't go in there. PERIOD. I was prescribed a new med that CVS didn't have stock of. But yeah, I walk into this gate and the greeter is just staring at me? And I'm like, ""How do I get out?!"" I was panicked and overreacting a LITTLE, considering I had to go in there in the first place. So you have to walk around those stupid little gates THAT HAVE NO REAL PURPOSE RIGHT NOW and exit where you check out.

In my opinion, Wal Mart was the ONLY way I could have contracted this virus and it pisses me off so badly that I don't actually know. If it was that guy that decided to turn around and invade my personal space, man...

I posted about it on our county's Facebook group (YES, some people have FB in 2020, it's still absolutely terrible but useful at times) and others had the same experience at this Walmart.

Out of all the non-metro/city counties, mine had the highest count. And my city still has the highest count. I may be doxxing myself but if you know where in NY I'm talking about it, you'll know how our city is. The mayor of our county (R) is hyped about re-opening. I've written to Cuomo's office and have heard nothing.

I may be doxxing myself but if you know where in NY I&amp;#39;m talking about it, you&amp;#39;ll know how our city is. The mayor of our county (R) is hyped about re-opening. I&amp;#39;ve written to Cuomo&amp;#39;s office and have heard nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for letting me say my part, if you got this thing, you truly are in my thoughts, no B.S. Write me. I could use a pen pal right now!&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been sick for months, and I’ve been in this place with you for so long. My heart goes out to all of you...this SUCKS. For real. 

Here’s just a few things that have helped me get through:

1) The anxiety is real, but sometimes it’s truly the virus. Have a plan for who to call and what to do that comforts you when you have a flare. (Weighted blankets, baths, music, breathing exercises, a good cry...We even adopted a dog once I could get out of bed a little, huge help!)

2) Don’t stop asking for help. If your doctor blows you off, get a second opinion. Get familiar with your insurance and your options. Ask other people who they saw. Go to the ER, the urgent care, the specialist. You KNOW when you’re sick. Get help, fight for it if you have to. There are people who will listen, but they might not be the first doctor you meet with. Keep asking!! 

3) Put your Devil Wears Prada attitude on when new symptoms come up, you feel sicker, or you flare. You’re a boss, take stock of what’s happening with control, don’t let those fear voices overwhelm you. Make a plan. Be the voice of reason for yourself, or find someone who can be (thanks to my scientist husband for doing this for me). 

4) Be kind to yourself. This might be over soon, or you may need more time to recover. It’s okay to take it. Take the time you need. Write yourself permission slips to do what you need to get well. 

The truth is, if you’re hoping for a quick fix, you’re going to crumble. 

That’s ok, it’s ok to let yourself feel sad or pissed and grieve how hard this is. 

It may take a while. But you’re going to be okay. 

It’s ok to let go of that “14 day” recovery. To put down that expectation to bounce back quickly, I promise you’re not a disappointment or a failure. Your body isn’t an enemy. It’s trying hard to help you.

,COVID19positive,"Hello! I am not positive myself, however I have noticed the large amount of plasma donation posts, and I wanted to offer some tips as a long time donor. 

I haven’t donated plasma in months, but I was a regular donor for a few years prior. 

Expect a large needle, and about an 30 min - 1 hr long donation. The overall process is nearly painless. Additionally, unlike blood, the saline solution keeps you hydrated and feeling great throughout the process. I felt so much worse after a 10-20 minute blood donation than I did after a plasma donation. 

Drink lots of water the day of donation, makes it much easier and faster. If possible lift weights prior to the donation to get your blood pumping. Use a stress ball to pump your fist during donation or else your hand may get tired. Some weird feelings during the donation, but continue to pump your fist as needed, and relax during the return processes. At the end, there will be a saline solution added, so expect slight chills and a weird taste in your mouth. If anything ever feels weird or hurts, talk to a worker and they will gladly help. Keep the bandages on and tight for approx 3 hrs to be safe. 

You might feel a bit weird after, but like I said, not nearly as bad as after a blood donation. I regularly worked 10 hr days, followed by a plasma donation and a 3 mile bike ride home. 

Overall, very simple process that can be a bit scary the first time. However, I do not want anything I said to deter you, it is a great way you are helping, and the process is easier than it seems.

I am not positive myself, however I have noticed the large amount of plasma donation posts, and I wanted to offer some tips as a long time donor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t donated plasma in months, but I was a regular donor for a few years prior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect a large needle, and about an 30 min - 1 hr long donation. The overall process is nearly painless. Additionally, unlike blood, the saline solution keeps you hydrated and feeling great throughout the process. I felt so much worse after a 10-20 minute blood donation than I did after a plasma donation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink lots of water the day of donation, makes it much easier and faster. If possible lift weights prior to the donation to get your blood pumping. Use a stress ball to pump your fist during donation or else your hand may get tired. Some weird feelings during the donation, but continue to pump your fist as needed, and relax during the return processes. At the end, there will be a saline solution added, so expect slight chills and a weird taste in your mouth. If anything ever feels weird or hurts, talk to a worker and they will gladly help. Keep the bandages on and tight for approx 3 hrs to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might feel a bit weird after, but like I said, not nearly as bad as after a blood donation. I regularly worked 10 hr days, followed by a plasma donation and a 3 mile bike ride home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, very simple process that can be a bit scary the first time. However, I do not want anything I said to deter you, it is a great way you are helping, and the process is easier than it seems. Listen to music, watch a show on your phone, and the donation will be done before you know it! (Just make sure to pump/relax as needed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You got this! And thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Just thought I'd share my symptoms since my experience wasn't nearly as bad as a lot of others who've posted on here. 

April 10th, started getting a sporatic dry cough. Didn't think much of it and felt mostly ok otherwise other than maybe a little tired. 

April 11th, woke up with a fever, bad aches and fatigue. That lasted through April 13th.

April 14th, aches started to go away but I developed a really awful headache. Still had a low grade fever

April 17th headache subsided but I developed bad eye pain. I started to lose sense of taste and smell around here too. Still had a low grade fever. I got tested on this day at a drive through testing center doing saliva tests.

April 19th, eye pain subsided but woke up with a rash on my legs and arms. Around here my lungs started to feel ""irritated"". It wasn't difficult to breath, but I could tell my lungs were inflamed. Still had low grade fever. Result came back positive from test on 17th. 

April 21st, my lungs were the worst this day. Still had no difficulty breathing but they were very inflamed and it would make me cough if I took a deep breath. Rash also spread to my torso and a little on my face. Still had a low grade fever. 

April 22nd, my body must have gotten a hold of itself and I woke almost all better. Lungs were very minimally irritated and rash was almost all gone. First day with a temp below 99. 

April 23rd, lungs still didn't feel 100% but I was otherwise feeling healthy. Fever did not come back after this and lungs slowly got better over the course of a few days. 


Overall the experience was miserable, but manageable, like any cold I've had, just longer. I work from home and there was only one day I wasn't able to work at all. I only took Tylenol for pain and fever reduction, and only needed to take it through the first half of the illness. 

I have two roommates, one never got symptoms, the other got a phlegmy cough and some fatigue for a few days. The roommate with the cough tested positive for it after I did. We weren't really isolating from each other since we live in a small apartment and didn't really have a choice. 

I also got an antibody test done on May 4th because I want to donate plasma, which came back negative. Though I've since been reading about how unreliable the current antibody tests are. I may try to get retested in another week to see if I can donate plasma. 

Ask whatever questions you'd like. I hope my symptoms can show people who are worried that it's not always as bad as some of the other posts on here.

Edit: Dates are not exact other than start and finish.

Edit2: sense of smell and taste came back a day to two after the 23rd.

I just noted that keeping a moderate dose in my diet seems to make things a little more bearable and I seem to feel a bit better off and on. (For all I know, that could be purely in my head, though.)&lt;/p&gt;

,COVID19positive,"Typing this up to share my experience with my presumed case of COVID 19. It helps to get it off my chest, and hopefully, this helps some of the rest of you out there. My apologies if this is long-winded.

Background: 23M, Black, Long Island, NY, 5’8, healthy, 165 lbs, daily juul-user and kratom user.

Supplements taken before and during: vit D, Iron, l-citrulline, folic acid, magnesium glycinate, cordyceps, b complex, zinc

Supplements added during: vit C, rhodiola rosea, turmeric capsule, make ginger tea throughout the day

&amp;#x200B;

Extra Notes:

&amp;#x200B;

\-  TESTING: I tested negative for COVID-19 about 3 weeks in but was presumed positive by a doc via tele-call, and tested negative for antibodies between weeks 4 and 5

\- FAMILY: My dad was never tested, but a day after my symptoms began, he was hit with 103-104 fevers, night sweats, exhaustion, the whole nine. The initial symptoms happed over the course of 14 days, and he has made a full recovery over the course of 4 weeks. My stepmother and stepsister have been exposed to him on a consistent basis since the beginning and neither have had any symptoms

\- NICOTINE &amp; KRATOM: I stopped using my juul April 1st. When things began to feel better during weeks 2 and 3, I began to vape small amounts (a pull or 2 a day) just to lessen the withdrawals but feared that it was making lung symptoms worse. I’ve switched over to nicotine gum while I continue to battle this. I’ve lessened the amount of kratom that I take but continue to take it daily.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My symptoms started on March 30th. It was a Monday night and I began feeling some light SOB that would continue into Tuesday night. I wasn’t sure if it was a symptom or all just in my head, so I chalked it up to just being anxious. Wednesday night, April 1st, a slew of symptoms began. As I was on the cusp of sleep, I had this weird feeling that someone was standing behind me, as if I “sensed” their presence. This isn’t abnormal, as I’ve had hypnogogic hallucinations when I’m about to fall asleep my whole life and I can always brush them off. This time, this feeling sparked a genuine sense of fear which shot my body right up out of bed. Within 5 minutes, I was sweating, quickly alternated between cold and hot, felt this tingling sensation that would travel up and down my body as if I was being pricked by tiny needles in waves, and I just felt mentally aloof. The best word I could use to describe the mental aloofness is goofy. I just felt like a giant goofball. I also had a low-grade fever of about 99.2-99.5. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the next 7 days, I would experience sweats, chills, aloofness, tiredness, and lethargic. It was weird, during this period everything seemed brighter and my pupils were dilated. I’ve had a few psychedelic experiences, and a low dose/microdose of shrooms is the closest thing that I can compare my perception to during this period. After the first week, SOB, the sensation of movement in my lungs, and chest tightness would be the main symptoms over the next 2 weeks. The initial chills and sweats subsided, and aside from the lung symptoms, I felt mentally spry, energetic, and like I was moving in the right direction. I was handling chores, playing games, and making music like normal. However, my lungs continued to feel weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the 21st night, I was hit with the same symptoms I experienced on April 1st, with about 80%-90% of the intensity of the first time. It was an odd night, my shortness of breath would intensify for a few minutes, then disappear as if my breathing was perfect, then intensify again while my body continued to get chills and my brain continued to get foggy. After that night, I had another week of battling those symptoms that I thought I was through with after the first week. It wasn’t pleasant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Monday (3 days from now) will make three weeks since that 2nd wave. Within the past week and a half, my shortness breath has been present in varying intensities, and I’ve developed small aches in my sides, arms, and legs. I’ve also been dealing with EXTREME fatigue. It’ll be 2-3 hours waves of tiredness that feels like I’m tired in every single fiber of my being down to my atoms. This fatigue usually comes with a sense of impending doom as feeling that tired just can’t be ok. Simply holding my phone up for 10+ seconds would feel as if I just did a few reps of weightlifting. My pulse has been on the higher side, resting in the high 90s and If I stand up it’ll jump up to 115. I’ve also had these small aches that come every 30min to 1hr that feels like it’s happening in my heart. They’re concerning for sure, but don’t feel major at this point, and I hope they remain that way.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I had fatigue early on, but I made an effort to get up and be in the sun for a bit and that seems to be the most impactful decision I’ve made throughout this whole thing. It was energizing being in its glow, which I didn’t expect being that I’ve been taking vitamin D daily for over 2 years. Last night wasn’t too bad. It felt like another wave was coming but it never arrived. Today my SOB has been minimal; unnoticeable at times, my energy has moments of being low, but has been pretty good throughout. The heart sensation has been happening at the same rate but seems to subside or lessen in intensity if I drink a good bit of water. On the bright side, my pulse has been consistently in the high 70s or low 80s and this is the closest to feeling normal that I’ve felt in a while. I feel like I’m moving in the right direction, but I am refraining from excitement, as I’ve felt good before, and have gotten hit with another wave, and I don’t know if or when that will happen again. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole experience has been mentally and physically exhausting. I’m currently on day 39 and I just want to feel normal again.  I’ve been glued to this subreddit the past couple of weeks, and I’m ready to be sick for a greater period of time if necessary. But like others have said, I need to know that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. We just won’t know until or if we reach the end. This subreddit has been both incredibly reassuring and anxiety-inducing at the same time. While I fear for what may be to come, it’s helpful knowing that what each us are experiencing is real although it’s not a part of the mainstream narrative.
